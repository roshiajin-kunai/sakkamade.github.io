    <p>“Enjoyed lavish breakfast, readied myself to leave for university.”<br />
Presently, such were happenings of my every morning to which I was looking forward each time. With that in mind, day after day the joy of being alive  was intensifying.<br />
The cuisine   of Honda-san might even eclipse a chef’s,  thought I, making a sandwich; so much so that without any joke I wanted to ask her, “Please prepare a miso soup for me every morning.” Otherwise, “May you become  my maid.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’m off to university. And you, Honda-san?”<br />
“Um—, first I shall find a part-time job, then a home.”<br />
“Now, don’t be in rush, you may stay for a little longer—.”</p>

<p>For me it is joyful to have tasty meals and someone to chat with.<br />
However, she shakes her head.</p>

<p>“As a rival, I cannot borrow your strength.”<br />
“<em>Now</em>?”</p>

<p>She have shown me stained with tears face, have served a meals, have lent a house and clothes; now is too late indeed.</p>

<p>“Oh, the time!? You should hurry or you will be late!”</p>

<p><em>Sure</em>, upon an insipid reply, I walked out the house.<br />
My gait was light, and if I relax my attention I will likely be skipping.<br />
Today I have a full schedule of classes  from the first to the fourth period. The long day have commenced. Now, let me devote myself to art today as well.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>×　×　×</p>

<p><br /><br />
“Your  artwork is skilful, Kominato-kun. Although skilful, rather heartless, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>Teacher  lamented, peering into my painting. The pupils round me have also paused their brushes and were staring at us.</p>

<p>“For this reason it’s so boring.”<br />
“…I see.”</p>

<p>Forthright:<br />
Heartless. Boring.<br />
I could not say anything back.<br />
Hastily storing away my tools, I grabbed the bag, and raised from my stool. Students were abuzz, but I care nothing.</p>

<p>“Kominato-kun?”<br />
“That’s enough for today.”</p>

<p>Saying thus, I left the painting I drew as is and headed for the classroom’s door.<br />
Teacher was in mute amazement,    belatedly realising the situation, however, the voice was raised.</p>

<p>“Class, class is still on, Kominato-kun!”</p>

<p>Without paying back a glance, I left the  classroom behind.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Facing the floor, dashing upon my way for nowhere.<br />
I had no destination. I had nowhere to go.<br />
I was not irritated at the words of the teacher. Albeit a little sulky, not to  extent of feeling annoyed.<br />
“Heartless,” “boring.”<br />
Quite so; right upon the mark.<br />
I have no heart. As such, being devoid of emotions, my art is boring.<br />
And when I was drawing it I had  no self-confidence, and was I discontent with the end result.<br />
Inconsistent.<br />
My ideals and emerging emotions, the results and actuality are paradoxical.<br />
I was frightened. Once again keenly aware of my boundaries.<br />
To be most precise, I had  not been bereaved of my emotions altogether, and hitherto keep a bare minimum of feelings as Tsugumi.<br />
However these are spurious article.<br />
Not of a truest heart. Embellished emotions, heartless art.<br />
Fake myself could move nowhere.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Forworn of walk, I seated myself upon the bench.<br />
The sky, having its boundless spread, at which I gazed, was of an unpleasant blue.</p>

<p>I cannot fly in the sky nor can I move anywhere.</p>

<p>Certainly, I would want to cry at such a  times,  I, however, have no tears to offer.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>×　×　×</p>

<p><br /><br />
“I’m back.”</p>

<p>As I opened the door, upon a <em>pitter-patter</em> of paces, she passed her steps towards me.</p>

<p>“Welcome home.”<br />
“Uh-huh, I’m home. What is it? You  staring so at my face.”<br />
“It’s nothing.”</p>

<p>Catching a sight of visage of  Honda-san, <em>Phew</em>, I felt relieve.</p>

<p>“Have you found a job?”<br />
“…Completely.”<br />
“Eh?”<br />
“Completely defeated.”<br />
“Seriously?”<br />
“Seriously; I applied for five interviews during the morning and was rejected perfectly!”<br />
“Why do you sound a little pompous!?”<br />
“How wasteful fail to notice so competent a witch  as I am.”</p>

<p>That is considerable confidence.<br />
Honda-san has a talent for culinary, well-spoken, and charming to look at, thence I did not dare to deem she would fail to ensconce herself in a part-time job, however I guess she have given a terrible replies at the interview. Uh-huh, I am of opinion she have said something excessive.<!--???--></p>

<p>“After defeat in the morning, what were you doing during the afternoon?”<br />
“I have explored this district​.”<br />
“Explored, have you…”<br />
“Patrolled, as a witch of justice.”</p>

<p>I am afraid she will make no dime from that.<br />
None the less, it is wonderful to behold her suffer no loss upon being rejected for a part-time job and keeping a dynamism. She is unalike a dull someone who  was just depressed.</p>

<p>“What did you learn?”<br />
“Nothing presently, but one point of the area is curious.”<br />
“Curious?”<br />
“Yes, I discovered traces of witchcraft’s use in several locations.”</p>

<p>Aren’t those are traces of my using witchcraft by emotions of others? Before I could  question so, she denies.</p>

<p>“Not yours.”<br />
“Then, do you imply that another witch is in this city?”<br />
“Right, although there was no sign of   presence of a witch.”<br />
“Not a sign, eh.., as though she holds no magical force.”<br />
“That would be you. There’s no so singular a witch as yourself.”</p>

<p>I was both happy as well as sad.<br />
In this case—</p>

<p>“You suggest  an extremely strong witch? The witch of so high an ability that her own magical force is imperceptible.”<br />
“Right, the witch who is capable of it.”</p>

<p>Yet another witch  in  Tokyo.<br />
There is no particular question in itself. Nothing is problematic to live a disguised life, not interfering with others.<br />
The question is: What does she employ a witchcraft for, having taken a troubles of coming to Tokyo?<br />
Majority of witches stay in Shikoku and will not absent themselves from there, unless it serves a purpose. We are timid and stability-oriented. In other words, witch who part Shikoku and has her reside in Tokyo is brave, fearless, and very likely harmful.<br />
What makes matters worse, no organization is established to govern witches.<br />
In preparations of becoming a witch, we are thoroughly taught the norms and duties of a witch from young age. Under the Western world, <em>Noblesse・oblige</em>—the duty of aristocracy. Our hearts are designed to permit no blunder.<br />
However, for my absence of emotions, I have faint an awareness of  witches’ obligations.<br />
On the other hand, Honda-san demand and force righteousness of a witch, so much so that have taken a name of the “Witch of Justice.”</p>

<p>“Do me a favour—”<br />
“I refuse.”<br />
“I haven’t spoken it yet.”</p>

<p>Because the solution is foreseeable.</p>

<p>“Come with me, we shall find this witch.”</p>

<p>It was no favour but coercion.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t my lack of witchcraft be a hindrance?”<br />
“I don’t expect you detect anything. I have no sense of land, however. Accordingly, you should be my guide.”<br />
“Why not just keep an eye at the phone map?”<br />
“I cannot trust a machine.”</p>

<p>That is what witches are.</p>

<p>“I have one more favour to ask.”<br />
“Ye, yes…”<br />
“I would hate an instant food for a dinner to-day.”</p>

<p>I should agree  with her on this one.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I visit a nearby supermarket together with Honda-san, as she has to prepare a meal for us. I pay, she cook. Give-and-take. I feel I benefit more than she does. Many thanks.<br />
I address Honda-san, who been intently regarding vegetables.</p>

<p>“What is for a dinner today?”<br />
“Classic curry it is.”<br />
“Whai—, Mama-Honda—.”<br />
“I fail to recall giving birth to such a child.”<br />
“…I am from the future.”<br />
“It’s embarrassing to have this exchange outside.”</p>

<p>We bought a lot of goods for  the occasion.<br />
It appears that we shall not be anxious over a meal for awhile now.</p>

<p>“That is heavy, I will carry that.”<br />
“This much, ‘tis all right.”<br />
“Never mind, for you have to prepare it after this.”<br />
“I need not your compassion.”<br />
“Then only this one.”</p>

<p>I steal one handle of the plastic bag.</p>

<p>“…”<br />
“…Say  something.”<br />
“We look almost as newlyweds.”<br />
“Wh, what!?”</p>

<p>Surveying flustered herself, I unintentionally let out a giggle.</p>

<p>“D, don’t laugh!”<br />
“S, sorry.”</p>

<p>Exiting supermarket, we walked through the shopping mall.</p>

<p>“Anyway, do you believe there is another witch in the Tokyo?”<br />
“Yes, I shall definitely   find her. As witch of justice, I cannot let such a matter to pass.”</p>

<p>Albeit highly motivated, we have not yet settled  that she is sinful witch.</p>

<p>“You should quit the university as soon as possible. With me and the help of a witchcraft, we shall rescue folk. The witch is the guide of the people.”<br />
“Um…”</p>

<p>Her thinking bears both righteousness as well as wickedness.</p>

<p>“Witchcraft is endowment putted into service of helping others. And is not something to apply to art.”</p>

<p>For me who have hit the wall, these are painful words.<br />
What the use of keeping to study art? Perhaps she is correct.</p>

<p>“You have the talent of witch.”<br />
“Mistake. I <em>had</em>.”<!--???--><br />
“But in spite of losing a force, you wield it still. No other witch might transform and harness the emotions of others.”</p>

<p>Certainly, technique has no record within textbooks nor within the history.<br />
Is this residue of the talent of “Tsugu,” or else my own tenacity?</p>

<p>The picture I saw back then.<br />
The tears which  streamed down my face when I should have had no emotions.<br />
The moment  my heart stirred.</p>

<p>I was rescued by that potent impression.<br />
And now I also desire to rescue someone in similar fashion, through the art.</p>

<p>“Say, Honda-san—”</p>

<p>Afore I could finish,<br />
The light suddenly went out—the district​ turned darkness.</p>
