    <p>“What? By what means are you carrying that thing​?”</p>

<p>Asked Noah, jet-black motorcycle.<br />
Yuuyami and Lydia has returned to the edge of Woodland.<br />
“That thing” Noah called Apricot— a female AD that Yuuyami was carrying.<br />
Before they noticed, Apricot closed her eyes and completely ceased operate.</p>

<p>“I will keep her on my back and ride Noah in tandem seat.”<br />
“It’s overweight. I’ll die. Pardon me.”<br />
“Hmm. Then I shall return afoot with her on my back.”<br />
“If so, you’ll return at sunset, you know?”</p>

<p>Slightly tilted her head Lydia.</p>

<p>“Do you have any other ideas?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami shifted her gaze at Lydia.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh, just watch,” Lydia raised her left wrist and operated the wearable; “Rapha! Help! Immediately get over here with emergency vehicle! I’m begging of you!”<br />
“Onee-chama!?”</p>

<p>Rapha’s voice can be heard from the wearable.</p>

<p>“I’ll be there in forty, wah, no, in thirty minutes!”<br />
“Eh? By any chance, was Rapha always monitoring my whereabouts?”<br />
“I… There was no such a thing! Wah, I had, free time, so I validated it just now!”</p>

<p>Answered Rapha, seemed to be very impatient.<br />
Wearables have not merely provided with communication feature, but also has embedded facility for transmission a location information.</p>

<p>“Hm-. Well, that’s fine-. I’m waiting.”<br />
“Wah, yes!”</p>

<p>Broadcast is over.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” gives a nod Yuuyami.<br />
“Since I received such great wearable, I have to use it.”</p>

<p>Shrugged her shoulders Lydia.</p>

<p>“The wording was a bit exaggerated, don’t you think?”<br />
“But, there was no untruth, right?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami reviewed the log from a while ago.<br />
“Help”—the hard fact, we wishing for her to help us.<br />
“Immediately get over here with emergency vehicle”—so to lay  Apricot therein.<br />
“I’m begging of you”—genuine request.<br />
Yuuyami slightly nodded.</p>

<p>“Indeed. No problem.”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Approximately thirty minutes elapsed.<br />
Rapha and Ohan approached the Woodland in emergency vehicle.<br />
Yuuyami laid Apricot down, in emergency vehicle, and grew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami.”</p>

<p>Sitting in emergency vehicle, Ohan called her.<br />
Apropos, Rapha was  now outside, having a chat with Lydia.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami also took a seat in the emergency vehicle.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami, beautiful.”<br />
“Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami was not modest. For she had been aware of her own attractiveness.<br />
If Yuuyami said: “I’m not beautiful,” it would be mere sarcastic remark.</p>

<p>“I am envious.”</p>

<p>Ohan was firmly observing Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Ohan also, you are cool. Lydia deems so.”<br />
“I want, to be beautiful.”<br />
“Are you signifying an outward appearance?”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
“Hmm. Why don’t you discuss it with Rapha-san?”<br />
“Ojou-sama believes, for AD decoration​s unnecessary.”<br />
“I see.”<br />
“Yuuyami’s voice, also beautiful. I want to alter my voice, so it is also would be beautiful.”<br />
“Ohan, are you, perhaps, becoming conscious?”</p>

<p>Envying of something; wishing for something. Such appeared rather humane.<br />
Even so, it has something that does not feel rightly.<br />
Yuuyami has never envied of something so tempestuous.<br />
Yuuyami satisfied with herself.<br />
Apparently, plenty of properties which even Yuuyami is lacking.<br />
However,<br />
these are not issues, for Lydia would fill them utterly.</p>

<p>“No. There are no signs of that. I am not conscious.”<br />
“I see. It’s curious. Whereas you are not conscious, then why would  you ask for such?”<br />
“That’s because Yuuyami wanted.”<br />
“Me?”<br />
“Wanted Lydia’s love.”<br />
“Ah-, I understand.”</p>

<p>Ohan was connected with Yuuyami once. Upon that time,  feelings of Yuuyami flowed into him. He was asked to facilitate the processing of emotions, to be exact.</p>

<p>“That is why, I want, to be beautiful, too.”<br />
“Please wait. I can’t connect it together. You wishing to be beautiful for my desire for Lydia’s love?”<br />
“I want, to be loved.”<br />
“By whom? Lydia?”<br />
“Because I want to be loved, I want, to be beautiful. If I would be beautiful, I will be loved.  Yuuyami and Lydia, both beautiful.”<br />
“Ohan misunderstanding. I do not love Lydia since she beautiful. I love her because she is Lydia.”</p>

<p>As though to verify words of Yuuyami, Ohan went silent.<br />
Yuuyami waited for Ohan’s reaction.</p>

<p>“Still, I want, to be beautiful.”<br />
“This is only my opinion, but Ohan is already beautiful enough. Likewise, you understand, I guess she loves you?”</p>

<p>Ohan did not utter a word.<br />
Perhaps he cannot comprehend Yuuyami’s words.</p>

<p>“If you understand it, and yet wishing to change your appearance, I shall request Rapha-san.”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“You found AD?”</p>

<p>Asked Rapha.<br />
Weather was nice today, optimal for exploration.<br />
Albeit, Rapha are not wishing to do that.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” Lydia nodded.</p>

<p>Lydia and Yuuyami desired viewing the world around. Today as well, they ran their motorcycle, and found AD.<br />
Rapha lightly sighed.<br />
Judging by broadcast, Rapha guessed that the two had fallen into grave situation.<br />
However, in fact, they merely wished to transport  AD.<br />
The relief and disappointment. One or two sighs naturally made its way out.<br />
With that being said however,</p>

<p>“Kunagi Woodland, huh.”</p>

<p>Regarded the Woodland Rapha.<br />
Woodland, that appeared to divide heaven and earth. The sky, the earth, and the Woodland. Here, such three colours were blend together.<br />
Rapha had, somewhat, strange feeling.</p>

<p>“Why does only here, remains so clear?”</p>

<p>World is destroyed. It has not a sign of humanity that were boasting their prosperity.<br />
However, Rapha believes.<br />
Such might be the correct scenery of the world.<br />
Wild land, and high sky. For sure such is genesis <em>paysage</em>.<br />
And Rapha,  do not hate its view.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But, I guess, they left it like this, intentionally.”</p>

<p>Lydia also peered the Woodland.</p>

<p>“Mika?”<br />
“Perhaps, me either.”</p>

<p>Silence.<br />
It was unknown of whose intention had that occurred. Upon seeing result, however, a possibility of there was no any volition at all seem to be accurate.<br />
Unless she would meet and talk to Mika, or Lydia’s recollection would return, anything could tread no further than​ mere speculations.</p>

<p>“Is she—” Lydia pointed at Woodland. “—here? Mika.”<br />
“Wah, I don’t know. But if Mika left the Woodland in such a state, it might be possible.”</p>

<p>Either way is  fine, thought Rapha.<br />
After all, Rapha are not going to look for Mika. I have no intentions exploring the Woodland. That is not  suit my nature.</p>

<p>“By the way, who is that Mika? If that’s cute girl, she can get on my seat.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, a strange voice could be heard.<br />
Rapha looked around restlessly, “What was that?”</p>

<p>“Me, me, it’s me. Ultra-sweet-bike - Noah-san. Nice to meet you, chibiko<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.”</p>

<p>Thus Rapha recognised owner of the voice.</p>

<p>“Motorbike speaks!? Moreover, does it called me chibi just now!?”<br />
“Oi, oi, bikes are talking nowadays, aye? Chibiko.”<br />
“Wah, how discourteous, to call me something like chibi at the first meeting! Wah, it’s violation of human rights! Wah, it’s discriminative term! Wah, it’s disgusting!”</p>

<p>Rapha  was being ranting, a raging fire  as though.</p>

<p>“Ah, oh-, m, my bad. I won’t say it any more. No joke.”</p>

<p>Noah succumbed to the vigour of Rapha and sincerely apologised.</p>

<p>“What is it? This unrefined  artificial intelligence…”</p>

<p>Rapha glared at Lydia.<br />
No matter how I’d look at it, Noah’s personality is not designed by Yuuyami. If Yuuyami, it would have had slightly better identity.<br />
Lydia can be the only one to set up such a foolish personhood. Moreover, no mistaking, she must have decided that on the spot, without much of thinking.</p>

<p>“Ah-, e-r,” Lydia averted her gaze away from Rapha; “I also think-, I overdid it a little–.”<br />
“If you understand, please rectify it as soon as possible!”</p>

<p>Rapha drew closer to Lydia’s face.<br />
Some further and the distance would have been enough for kiss, however Rapha has no intention of doing so.</p>

<p>“O—i, I guess I also have my own, even if not human, transport rights—”</p>

<p>Uttered Noah.</p>

<p>“Shut up!”</p>

<p>Rapha sternly glared at Noah.<br />
Noah fell silent.</p>

<p>“N, now-now. Calm down, alright?”</p>

<p>Lydia turned her palms towards Rapha, indicated a soothing gesture.</p>

<p>“Can you please revise it?”<br />
“No—, how about that—. Look, I have transport rights–.”<br />
“Onee-chama.”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
“There is no such a thing as transport rights.”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
“Please, rectify it, okay?”<br />
“Ah, er…”</p>

<p>Lydia swam her eyes around. As though in search for someone’s help.</p>

<p>“Come on,  we shall return back to the library.”</p>

<p>From behind Rapha, voice of Yuuyami was heard.<br />
Yuuyami finished stowing aboard​ an AD, and got out the emergency vehicle.<br />
However, Rapha believes. It was slow for Yuuyami. Naturally, I do not blame her for that.<br />
It would be good if she has no malfunction; only such were Rapha’s thoughts.</p>

<p>“What is wrong?”</p>

<p>Sideways inclined her head Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Mm—mm! Let’s return!”</p>

<p>Lydia noisily ran towards the voice, and wrapped her arms around Yuuyami’s waist.<br />
Oh dear, she escaped, thought Rapha.<br />
Nonchalantly, Yuuyami caressed Lydia’s head.<br />
Lydia closed her eyes in bliss.<br />
Upon seeing such pair, Rapha’s fury vanished somewhere far.<br />
Instead,<br />
Rapha grew awfully isolated.<br />
Whereupon,<br />
in the nook of that loneliness,<br />
I’m so jealous, thought the girl.</p>
