    <p>Strolling out of the library, Lydia  stretched out.<br />
It was a sunny and very pleasant day.<br />
Lydia outfitted with a black mesh jacket along with mesh pants. Each of which made of materials having a high defensive power.<br />
Taking into account considerably arisen  temperature, it is a little hot being wrapped by accustomed jacket and trousers.</p>

<p>“Well, now, it’s been a while since I’ve ride Noah-.”</p>

<p>Mumbling, Lydia strode to the garage.<br />
The garage, however, had no signs of Noah within.</p>

<p>“What-? Could it be that I forgot to take them off-line again-?”</p>

<p>Leaving the garage behind, Lydia commence to search all around.<br />
Whereupon,</p>

<p>“Haha—! Work, work, fools! Build a magnificent royal castle for me, you fools!”</p>

<p>At the Maker Factory construction site, mixed among the toil AD, was crying Noah.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p>Lydia approached Noah, wearing a wry smile.</p>

<p>“Oh-, Lydiko? Nah, I had spare time, so I pretend a dictator.”<br />
“Fun?”<br />
“No, not at all.”<br />
“Is, is that so.”<br />
“Aha-, having so much of free time, I was about to die.”<br />
“I’m sorry-. I keep forgetting to take you off-line all the time.”<br />
“Is it on purpose?”<br />
“…It’s, different…”</p>

<p><em>Whoosh</em>, Lydia diverts her gaze.</p>

<p>“Hmm, well, okay. First time in almost two weeks, he?”<br />
“That’s right. Something around it.”</p>

<p>Lydia had not counted the exact number of days.<br />
Under this world, the concept of time does not hold much of significance.<br />
Do what you wish, so much as you wish, and when you wish to do it. Such is life of Lydia.</p>

<p>“And Yuuyami-san?”<br />
“She should come soon.”<br />
“Will it be the first exploration in a while?”<br />
“Mm—mm,” Lydia shook her head. “Today just a roaming.”<br />
“Change of pace?”<br />
“No. After finishing a work, ‘I want to feel a wind,’ I thought.”<br />
“What were you working on? Also, <em>feel a wind</em>, it’s driving around with me, aye?”<br />
“We were creating a child. The point of <em>feel a wind</em> is correct.”</p>

<p>Lydia and Yuuyami had yet accomplished their child.<br />
Albeit have hitherto not put them on-line.</p>

<p>“Child? But you have no pregnancy vitals, aye-?”<br />
“It’s different, different,” <em>whosh-whosh</em>, waved her hands Lydia. “My and Yuuyami’s child are an AD.”<br />
“I see. This sort of thing.”<br />
“Uh-huh. There are plans for a party soon, would you, Noah, like to join either?”<br />
“What party?”<br />
“Celebration of completion the child, and wedding reception banquet​ for me and Yuuyami. So, I thought of introducing our child to everyone during the party.”<br />
“Hee-. Sounds fun. Will it be outside?”<br />
“Mm—mm. In the library. Noah should clean the tires before enter. If you break in full of dirt, Yuuyami will get angry.”<br />
“Aha–. Rather, please clean me up, Lydiko. I can’t do it myself, aye?”<br />
“Indeed. That’s right.”<br />
“Oh–. I leave it to you.”</p>

<p>Upon the moment Noah said so, Yuuyami made her way towards them.</p>

<p>“The progress seem to be nigh the seventy percent, won’t you agree?”</p>

<p>Remarked Yuuyami, peering up at the Maker Factory.</p>

<p>“Something about it.”</p>

<p>Lydia also turned her gaze up at the Maker Factory.</p>

<p>“Yoo, Yuuyami-san.”<br />
“Yes. It’s been a long time, Noah.”<br />
“Come on, I want to feel Yuuyami-san’s butt on my seat.”<br />
“Even if you will not be so impatient, we shall depart rather soon.”</p>

<p>Indifferently stated Yuuyami.<br />
Yuuyami bear her habitual maid outfit, and carries a backpack. She is afore prepared.</p>

<p>“Noah,” Lydia whispers to Noah: “like I said, Yuuyami’s bottom is mine, in both name and fact, alright?”<br />
“Well, mine only the right side.”<br />
“No—, it’s mine altogether.”</p>

<p>Upon displaying a friendly grin, Lydia mounted Noah.<br />
However,</p>

<p>“I shall drive today.”</p>

<p>Whereafter, since Yuuyami said so, Lydia dismounted Noah.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami smiled, and saddled Noah.</p>

<p>“Ha-, I missed it.”<br />
“Like I told you, it’s mine.”</p>

<p>Whereas saying that, Lydia taking a seat upon a tandem seat.</p>

<p>“Plainly, my buttocks are mine. Withal, Lydia’s buttocks are also belongs to me.”</p>

<p>Gravely stated Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Haha—. Even so, the both upon me now!”<br />
“Well, yes.”</p>

<p>Replying, Yuuyami twisted the throttle.<br />
Noah leisurely proceed forth.<br />
Yuuyami fixed the speed at forty kilometres per hour.<br />
Lydia quickly realised, she had set such in favour of enjoying the conversation.</p>

<p>“Ah, incidentally, Noah.”<br />
“What is it, Lydiko.”<br />
“When did you get acquainted with Mika?”<br />
“Mika—, Angel-chan?”<br />
“Right. Angel-chan.”<br />
“That was when I had a spare time at the Woodland. Although Angel-chan came to meet Lydiyami-san, but, for  time was bad, it seems that she came to me.”<br />
“Lydiyami-san?”</p>

<p>Tilted her head Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Aha. A name used to call Lydiko and Yuuyami-san together.”<br />
“Eh—? What’s with that–.”</p>

<p>Said Lydia, however,</p>

<p>“No, no. It is fabulous, Lydia and me are adjoined each other!”</p>

<p>Yuuyami appeared to be pleased with that.</p>

<p>“Seriously?”<br />
“Certainly.”</p>

<p>For Yuuyami brimmed with confidence, well, okay, thought Lydia.</p>

<p>“Shall we change Lyu・Industry to Lydiyami・Industry likewise?”<br />
“No. I think Lyu is better. Sounds better.”<br />
“I see. All right.”<br />
“Well, at any rate. Lydiyami, have you met Angel-chan?”<br />
“Uh-huh. She asked to give Noah her regards.”<br />
“I see, I see. We together with Angel-chan had a morning-to-home ship. I want to see her again.”<br />
“Morning-to-home?” “You won’t see her again.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami and Lydia’s remarks overlapped.</p>

<p>“Morning-to-home, means what it says. We were driving around until the morning. So, why we can’t meet any more?”</p>

<p>Noah was able to accurately distinguish speech of the pair.</p>

<p>“She told something of going very far away.”<br />
“So far that I can’t reach?”<br />
“Uh-huh. That’s what she said.”<br />
“I see. It’s lonely. But, well, she returned back to the God.”<br />
“Why God?” tilted her head Lydia.<br />
“Ha? The only place where Angel-chan will return home is to the God, aye-?”</p>

<p>Upon Noah said that, something flashed within Lydia.<br />
The feeling akin the each of the scattered puzzle-pieces are neatly fitted now.<br />
That was fantastic, consimilar to insight, my heart was pounding.</p>

<p>“That’s it–!”</p>

<p>Unintentionally exclaim​ Lydia.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Yuuyami.<br />
“Ehehe, I know Iris’ identity.”<br />
“Are you sure? How did you find out?”<br />
“Hint is <em>the God</em>.”<br />
“God… God.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami with an utmost effort rummaged through​ the log.<br />
Every single conversation wherein Lydia mention the true character of Iris. The period from her awakening amid the library, until I had awakened in Underground.<br />
When Lydia conversed with Yuuyami in its regard.<br />
There was a brief silence.</p>

<p>“I also realised it,” said Yuuyami.<br />
“Well, then, let’s compare the answers together?”<br />
“All right.’Yes, our engineers must have wanted us to enjoy the game, no mistaking it!’”</p>

<p>Yuuyami reproduced Lydia’s statement.<br />
It was a line as we had dialogue apropos of consciousness, upon the day when garage was complete.</p>

<p>“Correct!”<br />
“In other words, Iris is the engineer of this planet?”<br />
“Right. In sense, perhaps they are God.”<br />
“The word <em>Creator</em> would be closer, wouldn’t it?”<br />
“That’s right. Uh-huh, Iris is the Creator. Consequently, an engineer. But, what is Aki-chan?”</p>

<p>Mika called the Iris <em>Aki-chan</em>. That is the only part Lydia unable to grasp.</p>

<p>“I shall search for relevance.”<br />
“Please.”</p>

<p>And another moment of silence flowed in.</p>

<p>“I discovered the name seeming to be related.”<br />
“Tell me.”<br />
“The Anunnaki.”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br />
“Anunnaki?”</p>

<p>Lydia had never heard of it.<br />
However, they certainly can be called by the nickname Aki-chan.</p>

<p>“In an ancient Sumerian civilisation the word signify - gods. Either it, or the people who descend  from the sky.”<br />
“Sumerian… Er, it’s quite mysterious civilisation, right?”</p>

<p>Lydia recalled a time when she was studying history together with Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Yes. That was rather advanced civilisation, however we shall put it aside. The Anunnaki are <em>extraterrestre</em> who created humanity.”<br />
“<em>Extraterrestre</em>!?”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>What a funny vocabulary, thought Lydia.</p>

<p>“Well, I shall denote it’s but according to one of the theories.”<br />
“Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay, okay, continue.”<br />
“They say humanity were created by crossing their own DNA with apes.”<br />
“ID evolution theory, isn’t it?”<br />
“Yes. ID - intelligent design.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> In other words, creation of human-kind by beings of higher intelligence. By higher existence I signify the Iris.”<br />
“Wah-, everything is connected! I’m so thrilled! Hey, let’s go to the Underground right now?”<br />
“Rapha-san’s place, isn’t it? All right.”<br />
“And then, let’s advance into the Dream Server and ask Iris!”<br />
“Understood. We shall speed it up.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami alter the direction of Noah by moving her weight, and twisted the throttle.</p>

<p>“After all Noah is the best motorbike ever!”</p>

<p>Cried out Lydia.<br />
It was with assistance of Noah we met the answer.</p>

<p>“Oh–. I don’t really get it, but I’m the best bike ever!”<br />
“Uh-huh! The best in universe—!”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>As usual rising alone upon the surface, Ohan caught Lydia, Yuuyami, and Noah with a visual sensor.</p>

<p>“Ojou-sama.”</p>

<p>Ohan communicates Rapha in the Underground.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Response from Rapha seem to be a little sleepy.</p>

<p>“Lydia-sama and Yuuyami are approaching.”<br />
“What was that!?”<br />
“Lydia-sama and Yuuyami are approaching.”</p>

<p>Ohan repeated.</p>

<p>“Surprise attack!?”<br />
“Surprise attack?”<br />
“Wah, it’s terrible! Wah, my hair unkempt!”<br />
“Is that so.”<br />
“Wah,  I’m even in my pyjamas!”<br />
“Is that so.”<br />
“Wah, it’s awful! Wah, I have to comb my hair and get dressed right away!”<br />
“Haa…”</p>

<p>Rapha seemed flustered, however Ohan does not fathom why she needed to panic.</p>

<p>“Alright? You cannot bring onee-chama party inside.”<br />
“Why?”<br />
“Wah, to protect my gracefulness and image of a maiden!”<br />
“Is that so? What should I do?”<br />
“Can you tell them to await until I come out?”<br />
“Understood.”</p>

<p>It is not easy to be graceful maiden, remembered Ohan.</p>
