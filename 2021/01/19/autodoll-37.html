    <p>Hinagiku comforted convulsively sobbing Rapha.<br />
In a meanwhile, Yuuyami proceed a <em>self-check</em>.<br />
Apparently, my condition is different from usual. Not a distinct​ defect, it is worth, however, keeping in mind.<br />
Lydia is standing next to Yuuyami, observing the situation.<br />
Hmm, Yuuyami begin to recognise her own condition.<br />
There is a load upon the quantum brain, and the temperature within my body is heightened.<br />
However, such cannot be described as an intense heat generation. To express it humanly, it is  as being affected by slight fever.<br />
Origin of the load was immediately cleared by Yuuyami.<br />
The emotions.<br />
The great affection towards Lydia is the origin.<br />
Yuuyami was able to handle emotions well, up to certain extent, however not completely.<br />
Albeit, I didn’t shut down, and the processing performance improved significantly, in comparison to the previous time.<br />
Such is no exaggeration to say - I has grown.</p>

<p>“Lydia,” whispered Yuuyami.<br />
“Mm?” Lydia peered at Yuuyami.<br />
“Apparently I have been a little swayed by emotions.”<br />
“A little?”<br />
“Yes. A little, indeed. Thereupon, appears that my words and conducts were under somewhat high tension.”</p>

<p>Stated Yuuyami, upon verifying her action log.</p>

<p>“Are you alright now?”<br />
“Yes. By noticing a load, the load itself has been substantially reduced. I wonder why?”<br />
“Is it because by realising you have accepted it? To be honest, I don’t really understand either.”<br />
“I see. Incidentally, what is unparalleled love?”<br />
“That is even less clear–.”</p>

<p>Giggled Lydia.<br />
Likewise, even Yuuyami herself couldn’t really understand it, upon being calm. However, able to comprehend the pretext of inventing that phrase.<br />
Expression <em>I love you</em> was not enough. My feelings for Lydia were so extensive that these words were insufficient.<br />
Actually, somewhat I hitherto believe so. However, I have also reflected that a phrase <em>unparalleled love</em> was not very suitable.</p>

<p>“Listen, Lydia.”<br />
“What is it now?”</p>

<p>Lydia displayed a friendly grin.</p>

<p>“To be honest, tonight…”</p>

<p>I have to say. This is rather important than conveying my love. No, the act itself is an ultimate courtship, believed  Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Tonight?”<br />
“That is…”</p>

<p>I wish to put a sexual intercourse into practice— however I cannot say this much, for some reason.<br />
Once again, quantum brain of Yuuyami grew a load. Likewise I can feel the temperature arising.</p>

<p>“Listen…”</p>

<p>I am likely to overheat,  thought Yuuyami. However, in reality, temperature wasn’t so high.<br />
Lydia tilted her head, awaiting for Yuuyami’s words.<br />
I have to say. I have to express my intention: tonight is excellent.<br />
The more I think over it, the more at loss of the words I become, for some reason.</p>

<p>“So, that is…”</p>

<p>That’s frustrating, thought Yuuyami.<br />
Emotions hinder my calm utterance.<br />
Nevertheless, I cannot grasp this feeling. This is different from love, the emotion is related rather to my very self. I have never experienced this emotion afore.<br />
Yuuyami was restlessly wandering her gaze.<br />
To describe it humanly, her eyes  swam around.<br />
Whereupon, unnoticeably, Rapha ceased weeping.</p>

<p>“Yosh, yosh, I’ll repair him in a minute, look forward to it. But before anything else, I have to tell Lucy.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku patted Rapha’s hair, and  looked towards Lydia.<br />
Never, thought Yuuyami.<br />
Never courting after Lydia. I guess I will be surpassed.<br />
However,</p>

<p>“I’m sorry Lucy. Forgive me. Forgive me for locking you, and making you feel unpleasant.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami fears were unfounded.<br />
<em>Whew</em>, Yuuyami grew a breath, relievedly.</p>

<p>“It’s not Lucy, waaa!”</p>

<p>Rapha cried out a little more.</p>

<p>“Lucy-onee-chama is deeaad! Onee-chama is Lydia-onee-chamaaa!”<br />
“Right, that’s right. It’s different, sorry, Rapha. It’s Lydia, not Lucy.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku stroked Rapha’s hair again.</p>

<p>“I forgive you,” said Lydia: “for imprisoning, for mistaking my name, for destroying Ohan.”<br />
“Thank you, Lydia. I’ve behaved really foolishly. Excuse me,  I must have certainly lost my sanity. I’ve been alone for a long time, I guess my mind is broke a little.”<br />
“A little?”  tilted her head Lydia.<br />
“No, quite.”<br />
“So? Are you feeling better now?”<br />
“I’m better.”<br />
“Why is that?”<br />
“Perhaps, because it became bustling… What’s more.”</p>

<p>During her speech, Hinagiku trod, and picked up the vial which had fallen upon the floor.</p>

<p>“Because this fellow taught me. I’ve been taught throughout a long time, but I didn’t listen to this chitin.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku regarded the vial,​ with love.<br />
Yuuyami instantly​ recognised: in the vial is the moss.</p>

<p>“Is that moss evolved?”</p>

<p>Consequently, I questioned such. Ordinary moss does not speak. Nor teach humans anything.</p>

<p>“No, that’s not the case.  I know it may sound strange, but I can hear its voice.”<br />
“I see. That’s auditory hallucination. Appears like it shall be better to check your health.”</p>

<p>Indifferently stated Yuuyami, as she always did.</p>

<p>“No, it’s different. This sort of thing… No, it’s certainly hallucination, but my health isn’t bad. I mean, it’s called imaginary friend…”<br />
“That’s auditory hallucination​ and delusion. Appears like it shall be better to check your mental health rather than your physical condition.”<br />
“Ah-, that is, I’m crazy, I know. So I’ll ask you, don’t take it too seriously.”</p>

<p>In search for help, Hinagiku peered at Lydia.</p>

<p>“Hinagiku was insane from the beginning, so that’s normal, you know, Yuuyami,” stated Lydia. “Therefore, you don’t have to worry about it.”<br />
“It is normal to be insane? How unusual.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami  slightly tilted her head.</p>

<p>“Mama-Hina was eccentric for a long time! Rather than that, please cure Ohan sooner!”</p>

<p>Said Rapha, with a visible anger.</p>

<p>“Alright. Excuse me, Yuuyami, can you bring Ohan’s body to the basement?”<br />
“Understood.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami made her way to the doorway of the lodge.</p>

<p>“Wait,” called Hinagiku. “Don’t perforate the floor this time. There is regular entrance.”<br />
“Understood.”</p>

<p>After Yuuyami went outside, a sigh escaped her lips.<br />
I couldn’t transmit a request for sexual activity.<br />
The sun is already setting.<br />
Tonight is nigh.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“Ohan, can you hear me?”<br />
“Yes.”</p>

<p>Ohan, consisting with nothing but head, answered the question of Yuuyami.<br />
Ohan’s head being connected to the computer through the Lightning Blade, and was booted up against energy supply of the computer.<br />
This is a basement of the lodge. Facilities are prepared. Repairing Ohan here shouldn’t be  complicated.<br />
However, afore that, Yuuyami had something to tell to Ohan.<br />
Lydia, Hinagiku, and Rapha, three of them, were silently watching over the situation.<br />
Yuuyami has already told the three that she wishes to chat with Ohan in prior of repair.</p>

<p>“At present, you are broken.”<br />
“Yes. I have destroyed myself. The log is normal.”<br />
“Thereupon, you are going to be repaired, but ahead of that, I have a question.”<br />
“What is it?”<br />
“Ohan, you said you wanted to alternate your appearance, do you still wishing it?”<br />
“Yes.”</p>

<p>Without hesitation answered Ohan.</p>

<p>“Understood. Now, taking the opportunity of repairing, it’s possible to change your appearance. But before that, please take a look upon my log.”</p>

<p>After saying that, Yuuyami insert the Lightning Blade in his right wrist.<br />
Whereupon, shared a part of the action log with Ohan.<br />
The log related to Rapha.<br />
Memory of the time whereas Rapha sobbed, crying that Ohan was her friend.<br />
Yuuyami understood - Ohan is reviewing disclosed log.<br />
Yuuyami, thus, awaited until Ohan see through the whole part of it, and unplugged Lightning Blade from his wrist.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” asked Yuuyami. “You are loved. Not in romantic sense, however you are  certainly loved.”</p>

<p>Ohan remained silent and looked at Yuuyami with his vermilion visual sensor.</p>

<p>“I shall ask once again. Do you want to alternate your appearance?”</p>

<p>Then, after short pause:</p>

<p>“No,” answered Ohan.<br />
“I see.”<br />
“Yes. I am satisfied, Yuuyami. Thank you very much.”<br />
“You are welcome.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami smiled at Ohan.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama, what are they talking about, Yuuyami and Ohan?”</p>

<p>Whispered Rapha.</p>

<p>“Er, about how much Rapha loves Ohan.”<br />
“I see. I love Oha…n, ha-!?”</p>

<p>Rapha distorted her countenance.<br />
Lydia covered her mouth with both hands. However it’s slightly too late, considered Yuuyami. It doesn’t make sense if you didn’t hold it before speak.</p>

<p>“I can’t have any affection for AD!! Are you stupid!?”</p>

<p>Shouted  Rapha, with a flushed face.<br />
No, it shouldn’t be like that, thought Yuuyami.<br />
Therefore,</p>

<p>“Even though Ohan is my frieeend.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami excerpted  her words from the log, as an evidence.</p>

<p>“Wh, what is that!? It’s mimicry​ of me!? Or rather, I never said that! I didn’t say that, I didn’t say that!”</p>

<p><em>Thunk, thunk</em>, Rapha bounced upon the floor. Lydia spread her arms.<br />
Mimicking Lydia, Yuuyami spread her arms likewise.<br />
Oh, dear.</p>
