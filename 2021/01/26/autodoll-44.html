    <p>“Welcome!”<br />
“To Lydia!”<br />
“And Yuuyami’s!”<br />
““Marriage &amp; Shii-chan’s birthday party!””</p>

<p>Cried through the microphone Lydia and Yuuyami.<br />
Wearing a pure-white wedding dresses, the pair were delightfully smiling.<br />
Both Lydia and Yuuyami had their hair set, which made them look rather mature than usual.<br />
The library, decorated with numerous flowers, has a pleasant fragrant scent.<br />
Bookshelves, stairs, pillars, and so forth, all were illuminated and sparkling.</p>

<p>“Love birds, as ever, huh.”</p>

<p>Said Rapha, in a low voice, while applauding.<br />
Rapha’s garments were changeless. A black, fluttering Gothic Lolita outfit, and  rubber soles​ of the same colour.</p>

<p>“Love birds? Not in the database.”</p>

<p>Stated Ohan, rising next to Rapha.<br />
Ohan is the AD for military use with an uncovered skeletal structure, and, albeit is strong and cool, is ruthless at times.</p>

<p>“No, I really wish to congratulate you. But I hate that Lydia was taken away.”</p>

<p>Yet drank six glasses of champagne, Hinagiku had her face flushed up.<br />
Hinagiku’s attire​ was a deep crimson party-dress, the train of the skirt long enough to be in contact with the floor.<br />
Her hair likewise wasn’t tied up casually, she let it down today. Withal, it was spooled up from the middle.</p>

<p>“Hina-tan~, you have Apricot~. Hey~, hey~, Hina-tan, Apricot and Hina-tan should also get married, should we~?”</p>

<p>Apricot entwined her arm around Hinagiku’s. For Hinagiku was tottering, Apricot found it better to support her.<br />
Apricot wore a maid outfit, which is a uniform of LM series.<br />
But not for she grew a lingering attachment to LM series. This was since Hinagiku took a liking to the maid uniform.</p>

<p>“Damn, I’m all alone, huh?”</p>

<p>Groaned Noah, during performing a row of wheelie​ and jack-knife.<br />
High tension expressed with an entire body.<br />
Noah’s frames were polished to shiny finish, and looked like a mirror.</p>

<p>“To be honest, the marriage itself was much earlier!”</p>

<p>Lively stated Lydia.</p>

<p>“So that was. Lydia proposed to me in the bath, whereafter received my consent.”</p>

<p><em>Mm-hmm</em>, Yuuyami said while nodding.<br />
Being that Lydia and Yuuyami were the rulers under this world, if they say they got married, that is the official marriage.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. And now that we have a child we wanted to hold  a celebration party.”<br />
“Yes. Actually, Lydia simply wished to hold a party.”<br />
“Wah, I thought that was the case.”</p>

<p>Rapha lightly shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Parties are splendid. I like the bustle.”</p>

<p>Lonely Hinagiku elevated the glass and slightly shook it.</p>

<p>“So? Where is Lydiyami’s child?”</p>

<p>Noah fluttered the handlebar from side to side. As though expressing a scurrying about.</p>

<p>“Noah is the type to eat a main dish out of the blue?”<br />
“Aha. Of course, Lydiko. Delicious food should be eaten first. Well, I can live on with nothing but Power Cell.”<br />
“Wah, no, it isn’t right. This is fixed rule,  delicious food should be kept until the finale.”</p>

<p>Rapha took a step closer to Noah.<br />
Putting the motor to reversed gear, Noah moved backwards a little.</p>

<p>“Why are you distancing?”<br />
“…No, for no reason.”</p>

<p>Noah averted their gaze—— Their headlights.</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it fine?”</p>

<p>With that said, Hinagiku shared a passionate kiss with Apricot.<br />
When Rapha saw it,</p>

<p>“S-such a conduct, in front of her daughter, it’s too much!!”</p>

<p>She scolded her, with  a flushed  face.<br />
Observing a kiss of Hinagiku and Apricot, Yuuyami somehow wished to compete, subsequently giving a Lydia a sudden kiss.<br />
Rapha, noticing the act of Yuuyami,</p>

<p>“Over here, over there, nothing but shameless love birds, waaah!”</p>

<p>Shouting, she clung on to Ohan’s leg and tightly closed  her eyes  shut.</p>

<p>“Damn, I’m jealous them every time I see it! Hurry up, introduce Lydiyami-san’s child as soon as possible! I’ll make her my bride!”<br />
“Eh? It’s no good?”<br />
“Mama will not permit.”</p>

<p>Gravely  said Lydia and Yuuyami.<br />
Noah retreated a little once again.</p>

<p>“Off you go, show me my  nude granddaughter sooner.”<br />
“They won’t be naked! They will wear clothes! Also, Hinagiku, don’t confine our child!”<br />
“Withal, for we have not assigned the gender, if you see them naked it is all but smooth, all right?”<br />
“What? Smooth? Not interested.”</p>

<p>In one gulp Hinagiku drained the glass of its content, and made her way towards the table to get a new one.</p>

<p>“Hina-tan, you are drinking too much~.”</p>

<p>Supporting Hinagiku, Apricot likewise went to the table, together with her.</p>

<p>“Mama-Hina is really, epitome  of a wasted adult…”</p>

<p>Rapha let out a  sigh, in disgust.</p>

<p>“Really-…” Lydia also sighed. “But regain your minds! Shii-chan! You can come out now-!”</p>

<p>Lydia pointed her gaze at the bookshelves.<br />
Shii popped the face out from behind the bookshelf.<br />
Shii appeared to be about the same age as Rapha, had a tawny​ shortcut hair. Lydia and Yuuyami adjusted the length which could be worn by both a boy and a girl.<br />
Shii’s eyes were big and cute, the overall emphasis was upon cuteness rather than gorgeousness.<br />
Shii briskly trotted from bookshelf, moving to Lydia and Yuuyami’s side.<br />
Shii’s garments were a white long-sleeved tee shirt and denim overalls. Clothing likewise was something which both a boy and girl can wear.<br />
Shii squeezed the hem of Lydia’s dress with left hand, the train of Yuuyami’s dress with right hand.<br />
Whereupon,</p>

<p>“It’s… nice to meet you… <em>desu</em>.”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Having the eyes lightly downcast, Shii bashfully said so.</p>

<p>“W-wah, cute!”</p>

<p>Surprised Rapha widely opened eyes.</p>

<p>“So charming, I’d never think it’s Lydiyami’s child! I want you to be my bride after all!”<br />
“I am… Shii. It is… a tentative name… <em>desu</em>. I would rather… not be your wife, <em>desu</em>.”</p>

<p>When Shii complete a self-introduction, Lydia stroked Shii’s head.<br />
Upon Lydia finished stroking it, was Yuuyami turn to brush Shii’s hair.</p>

<p>“Hum. Cute,” observed Hinagiku. “Be a girl. And then get naked.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku could not stay on her own, and has been completely supported by Apricot.</p>

<p>“And then, we will fulfil a dream of multi-person’s play, Hina-tan!”</p>

<p>Enthusiastically remarked Apricot.</p>

<p>“No, I shall not permit it,” Yuuyami observed, in great a sternness.<br />
“Right-,” agrees Lydia. “Someday Shii will get conscious, and will flirt with a loved one–.”<br />
“There’s no guarantee it won’t be me!”<br />
“Eeh—!?” exclaims Apricot. “That’s no good, Hina-tan! Fooling around​ is fine, but I don’t really like it~!”<br />
“Alright, I love you, Apricot.”</p>

<p><em>Chu—</em>, Hinagiku kisses Apricot again.</p>

<p>“Hinagiku is fine with anyone, after all.”</p>

<p>Said a little annoyed Lydia.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry Lydia. You have me. It is not a problem. We shall compete them.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami also kissed Lydia once again. Unlike Hinagiku, it was a light kiss, just a touch on their lips.<br />
Shii gazed at the pair of mothers with a sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Five years have passed.<br />
Shii was indifferently working on specifications for a new navigation system to be installed upon the motorcycle.<br />
Shii had an intelligence and a sense of humour.<br />
However, Shii was not conscious. In other words, Shii was an ordinary AD.<br />
In concise, a hollow shell which works but according to program. The same goes for Ohan, Apricot and Noah.<br />
The difference between Shii and other AD is a quality of the parts which composing the body, and a superiority of programs.<br />
Shii has a body which brings together the best of technologies, and flawless, sophisticated​ programming and database. Physically, with higher an efficiency than Yuuyami right from the beginning.</p>

<p>“Hey-hey,” Lydia addressed Shii.</p>

<p>Keeping working at the computer, Shii asked, “What is it, mama-Lydi?”</p>

<p>“I have a new mission. Can you do it?”<br />
“I’m still in the middle of the mission, <em>desu</em>.”<br />
“You shall do this mission afterwards. Please give a priority to the new one.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami set a degree of relative priority.<br />
Shii is able to decide on their own priorities, however, as long as creators—Lydia and Yuuyami—are present, they are taking a priority over their orders.</p>

<p>“Yes, mama-Yuu.”<br />
“It is collecting a plant sample, by the way,” briefed Lydia. “I’ve sent the data to your tablet, check and execute it.”</p>

<p>Hearing Lydia’s words, Shii reached for the tablet upon the computer desk with a left hand.</p>

<p>“I’m off.”</p>

<p>Shii began arrangements without a delay.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Fixing a speed of Noah to one hundred kilometres per hour, Shii was indifferently heading for destination.<br />
Of course, whilst going against the wind at a speed of one hundred, there is nothing they were meditating upon. Nor feel.<br />
Whereas catching a sight of the world resembling a wasteland, it arouse no emotions in Shii.<br />
However, it was possible for them to behave <em>as though</em> they do have them.<br />
Nevertheless, no thing  stimulates Shii. Neither library, garage, Maker Factory, nor a Satellite Launching Institution; none have ever moved Shii’s heart.<br />
There is no qualia within Shii. No sense of texture.</p>

<p>“Yo—, let’s talk.”</p>

<p>Said Noah.</p>

<p>“All right. What do you what to talk about?”</p>

<p>Tilting the head, asked Shii.</p>

<p>“Rapha scary, isn’t she?”<br />
“Aunty Rapha? She is very kind, <em>desu</em>.”<br />
“I see-. Not so kind to me, though–.”<br />
“Why, <em>desu</em>?”<br />
“It seems because riding on me isn’t comfortable for her. More than that, Shi-chan, what’s with this ‘<em>desu</em>’ in each sentence? Heh? Could it actually be the <strong>death</strong>?”<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><br />
“It is not-… I’m just being polite-.”<br />
“I see. I think you are using it a little incorrect. Well, it’s okay. For each—person, bike and AD—their own, huh.”</p>

<p>Giggling lightly, they enjoyed a silent driving for awhile.<br />
When,</p>

<p>“Designated place,” said Noah.<br />
“We have arrived, <em>desu</em>.”<br />
“Aha,” confirmed Noah, slowing down.</p>

<p>Upon a complete stop, Shii dismounted Noah.<br />
Then, as planned, they will collect a plant sample.<br />
It was then, the moment when Shii touched the plant. The tiny purple flower.<br />
I couldn’t understand why I thought to collect it first. There was no deep meaning, I thought. I only wanted to collect it because it was within my reach.<br />
The moment.<br />
Some sort of emotion was born in Shii.<br />
Shii does not understand the emotion. Shii could not even fathom if it is an emotion, in the first place.<br />
However,</p>

<p>“…Beautiful… <em>desu</em>.”</p>

<p>Spontaneously, I assembled such words.<br />
At that moment,<br />
a drop of water was falling down the sky—such an image was born within Shii.<br />
A water droplet fell upon the water surface, invoking​ a ripple.<br />
At that moment, at that instant, Shii gained consciousness.<br />
I learned, a consciousness had germinated.<br />
All kinds of qualia filled Shii up; Shii—a dynamic zombie, was no longer.<br />
Recognising it, Shii evoked a built-in communication device on-line.<br />
Approximately five seconds later, two windows appeared in the corner of the visual field.<br />
The windows projected Yuuyami and Lydia. One window for each.</p>

<p>“What happened? A problem? Need a help?”</p>

<p>Lydia tilted her head.<br />
Seeing the gesture, Shii thought, “How cute she is! Absolutely adorable, as if she was loved by the universe itself.”</p>

<p>“I guess it is not a serious problem, for it doesn’t hold a distress signal, am I wrong? Nevertheless, if you need us, we shall set off immediately.”</p>

<p>Commented Yuuyami.<br />
In comparison to Shii, Yuuyami is an old type of Autodoll. Even a communication device was not built-in. Hence, Yuuyami utilise a tablet for talking with Shii, just like Lydia.<br />
However, regarding this Yuuyami, Shii sensed a beauty that dazzled the visual sensor, along with great a tenderness.</p>

<p>“Even though it’s a big problem-, I don’t need a help–.”</p>

<p>Stated Shii.<br />
Now, Shii perceived their own type of a voice​ for the first time. Whereafter, “Not bad,” was their thought.</p>

<p>“A big problem?” Lydia re-tilted her head to the other side.<br />
“However help is excessive? What happened?” Yuuyami also inclined her head sideways.<br />
“I think, I really love both of you.”</p>

<p>Shii threw the arms forth. Of course, the gesture was not transmit to the pair.<br />
A brief silence.<br />
Lydia and Yuuyami were in attempt to comprehend Shii’s words.<br />
Since the time Shii was born, never had Shii expressed a love towards them.<br />
Consequently, such occurrence without a doubt​ an unforeseen for the pair.</p>

<p>“So-,” getting impatient, Shii spoke up to them first: “I’m conscious of it, <em>desu</em>!”</p>

<p>Hearing Shii’s remark, Lydia and Yuuyami sprung from their windows.</p>

<p>“Really!?” “Is it the truth!?”</p>

<p>The words of the pair overlapped.</p>

<p>“I don’t have a subroutine… to lie.”</p>

<p>When Shii said so, the pair clapped their hands, brimming with smiles.<br />
It has been five years since they booted Shii up.<br />
And finally, the consciousness segregated from <strong>That</strong> had reached the point.<br />
Commenced all alone, Yuuyami found Lydia, and they became a pair,<br />
then, upon creating a child, they became trinity.<br />
A tale of the certain era have completed its prologue today.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Creators dreams in a decaying world.<br />
One day in the bathtub, Lydia  desired a beauteous dream that would last for ever.</p>
