    <p>Lydia, Rapha, and Yuuyami skinned Apricot’s artificial skin, and replaced some parts.<br />
Whereafter applied a new artificial skin, and changed colour of her hair to blue.<br />
For Rapha declared: ‘Wah, it’s uncomfortable for SA series to resemble onee-chama,’ hair colour was changed to the degree when she can obtain a peace of mind.<br />
Apropos, we have not hitherto dressed her.</p>

<p>“Wah, it wasn’t in such a bad condition as it looked.”</p>

<p>Said Rapha.<br />
The cause of Apricot’s outage was an unplugged Power Cell.<br />
Apricot moved a little, as energy seldom still remained within her.</p>

<p>“Indeed. Why did they throw her away, however, since she was not being broken?”<br />
“They must’ve lose interest in it. Disgusting. Satisfying wild instincts by using one SA series after another.”</p>

<p>Rapha said such, appeared to feel unpleasant from the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p>“Rapha, why are you  loathing  sex-related matters so much?”</p>

<p>Lydia cannot understand it well.<br />
Humans, whether new breed or archaic, having instinctively included into DNA the desire of procreation. Accordingly, in many cases, human kind​ liked sexual activity.<br />
Of course, that is not concern every single human. There are exceptions for everything.</p>

<p>“A, after all… it’s…”</p>

<p>Rapha’s cheeks blushed, afore she cast her eyes downward.</p>

<p>“After all?”</p>

<p>Tilted her head Lydia.<br />
Rapha looked at the floor as is, without utter any further.<br />
Albeit awaiting for a while, Rapha mouth remained shut.<br />
Lydia lightly shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Incidentally,” Yuuyami changed the subject: “there are traces that Apricot had her storage backup, afore initialization. What are your opinions apropos of  it?”<br />
“Is there any reason other than copying it to the new AD?”</p>

<p>Lifted her face Rapha.</p>

<p>“If that is truth, I guess, Rapha-san’s conjecture​ may be correct.”</p>

<p>The owner of Apricot got tired of her, and reproduced a new model of SA series. She guessed they copied the data from Apricot’s storage, for it would be troublesome to start from nought.</p>

<p>“Well, such is fine. Let’s reboot her?”</p>

<p>Lydia raised up her arms. I was eager​ for typing a restart command as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Please.”</p>

<p>At Yuuyami answer, Lydia typed in the command.<br />
Upon that instant, Apricot shoot her eyes open and rose her body. As following, she restlessly peered over her surroundings.</p>

<p>“Success.”</p>

<p>Lydia left the computer, and approached Apricot.</p>

<p>“Ojou-sama!”</p>

<p>Apricot stood up and swiftly embraced​ Lydia.<br />
Apricot’s bosom, that is larger than the one of Yuuyami, hit Lydia’s visage.</p>

<p>“What kind of play would you like to enjoy today~? Apricot~, can do anything~, as long as you install the archive~!”</p>

<p>Apricot said so, wearing a smile.</p>

<p>“What are you doing! Shabby <em>salope</em>!”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Rapha struck Apricot again and again.</p>

<p>“Don’t be jealous, tiny ojou-sama. Apricot is okay with threesome~!”</p>

<p>Apricot tightly hugged Rapha as well, with her left arm.</p>

<p>“Awawawah…”</p>

<p>Turning bright red,  Rapha’s face stiffened.<br />
Upon such occasion, Yuuyami brushed Apricot aside, thus, rescued Lydia.<br />
Whereupon, as yet holding Lydia, took a five steps away from Apricot.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami… this a bit, hurts, you know?”<br />
“Pardon me, I just.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami released Lydia.</p>

<p>“Ohan! Ohan!”</p>

<p>Shrieked Rapha.<br />
On the following moment, Ohan, who was pacing around in advantage to learn structure of the library, emerged nigh Rapha at ultra-high speed.<br />
All the while treading the soles through the floor, whereas knocking over some tables and chairs.<br />
Seeing that, “My library…”  whispered Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Attention. If you will not set ojou-sama free within next five seconds, you will be eliminated as hostile  nature.”</p>

<p>At Ohan words, Apricot instantly released Rapha, and raised her hands up.<br />
Apparently,  Apricot self-defence subroutine appears functioning properly.<br />
Rapha sprinted behind Ohan, and clung to his large leg.</p>

<p>“Hmm,” Yuuyami whispered: “after all, Rapha-san favouring Ohan. Do not you think thus?”<br />
“Eh? But I don’t think so?”</p>

<p>Lydia widely opened her eyes at Yuuyami’s words. What sort of interpretation she has, for reaching such conclusion; Lydia could not understand.</p>

<p>“You don’t think?”</p>

<p>Upon this time, Yuuyami was the one to snap her eyes open.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”<br />
“Why, please, look. The way she hugging him.”<br />
“That’s, she nothing but demand Ohan’s patronage, for he is stronger than herself, though?”</p>

<p>Rapha was frightened of Apricot— or rather embarrassed?<br />
Lydia did not understand Rapha’s feelings well.<br />
However, there was no fondness for Ohan in her hug. That much is certain.</p>

<p>“Such, the other viewpoint, may also be considered.”<br />
“This is the only viewpoint, though?”<br />
“Hmm,” Yuuyami slightly inclined her head sideways: “however, I guess, Rapha favouring Ohan…”<br />
“Albeit I have no idea what made you believe it is so, I can wager? Rapha doesn’t like Ohan.”<br />
“Well, then, the one to draw a blank shall repair the floor of the library.”<br />
“All right.”</p>

<p>Lydia pointed her palm up.<br />
Yuuyami lightly clapped her hand. That was a signal—the wager had been established.</p>

<p>“Now, what about Apricot?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami switched her gaze at Apricot, Lydia also peered at Apricot.<br />
Stark naked, solidified Apricot, having both of her arms raised as yet.</p>

<p>“First of all, dress her up, and  then have a dinner?”<br />
“Indeed. Thus shall be good–.”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Lydia gave Apricot <em>endommagé skinny denim</em>, and  striped black and white tee shirt.<br />
For Rapha had insisted that she should wear so modest a clothes as possible, were reproduced this kind of coordinated outfit.<br />
Upon  Lydia ask for the reason of why she desire her to wear plain clothes, Rapha replied angrily: ‘Because if it would wear flashy clothes, it would look like salope’.<br />
Albeit Lydia had no insight for the meaning of <em>salope</em>, she nodded at once.<br />
Apropos, at present, Apricot was sitting on the sofa with— out Lydia, Yuuyami, and Rapha, but a little away of the three.<br />
Ohan was rising beside Apricot, whereas watching her not to act arbitrarily.<br />
Lydia and Rapha sat adjoined each other​ before the table, and were eating potato salad.<br />
Such is the only dish within the dinner menu, for both having moderate nutrition.<br />
Yuuyami was observing Lydia eat, as usual.</p>

<p>“Say, Rapha, are you going to stay over today?”<br />
“If you, onee-chama, wishing me to, I can stay.”</p>

<p>Answered Rapha, appearing to be  unconcerned.</p>

<p>“I’m okay with either?”<br />
“If you want me to stay this much, I don’t mind stay for a day or so?”<br />
“I haven’t say this much, have I?”<br />
“Wah, it can’t helped-. I’ll allow myself to stay for today.”<br />
“Um, I see. I have to re-emerge pyjamas​ later.”<br />
“Wah, I want black one! And then, I’d like it with pompons and frills!”</p>

<p>Said Rapha, rather happily.<br />
She most likely was going to stay here from the beginning, thought Lydia.</p>

<p>“It is curious,” stated Yuuyami: “I do not think the conversation between the two of you was intertwined, however, for some reason, the conclusion was settled.”<br />
“Itsh oww mette…”</p>

<p>Rapha tried to speak with mouthful of potato salad, stopped halfway, however.<br />
Most likely for it is inelegant.<br />
Rapha properly swallowed content of her mouth afore continuing.</p>

<p>“It’s all a matter of <em>nuance</em>.”<br />
“Nuance…” Yuuyami searched through the database: “the subtle shades of colour, otherwise subtle implication of words… and unspoken intentions, is it?”<br />
“There’s an easier wording for it.”<br />
“Please tell me.”<br />
“Rapha wanted to stay from the beginning, she simply put on airs.”<br />
“Ah-, I see. Understood.”</p>

<p>Deeply nodded Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“I, I didn’t particularly say, I wanted to stay…”</p>

<p>Rapha  turned away swiftly.</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter either way. Incidentally, for tomorrow, can I go on exploration of Woodland with Ohan, would it be alright?”<br />
“Wah, no, it would not.”</p>

<p>Rapha answered distinctly, without a moment of thought.</p>

<p>“Why?”<br />
“Wah, Ohan is my property. I don’t want you to take it.”<br />
“I’ll return him by the dusk, okay?”<br />
“But I don’t like it.”<br />
“I’ll leave you with Yuuyami, as substitute.”<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami snap her eyes open, and  opens her mouth partly.<br />
Yuuyami was astonished from the depths of her heart, believed Lydia.</p>

<p>“Please wait a moment, Lydia. Why are you leaving me behind? What have I done? You wasn’t pleased upon a time I told you to close the book the other day? Or else, when I asked you to fold your clothes? Perhaps…”<br />
“Stop.”</p>

<p>Lydia turned her palms towards Yuuyami; as following, Yuuyami ceased speak.</p>

<p>“It’s not like that.”</p>

<p>Upon saying, Lydia  set afloat a wide grin.<br />
Whereafter, she turned her left palm up, and tapped it with right.<br />
If it was Yuuyami, she should understand the meaning.<br />
That is—if you get to know Rapha, you’ll realise that Rapha doesn’t like Ohan, so Lydia gain a victory​ in wager.<br />
And when Lydia would return from expedition, undoubtedly floor must be repaired.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Yuuyami analysed, and perceived Lydia’s gesture, at the spot.<br />
That is—I guess you can understand a result of wager, if you spend a day with Rapha? And since, probably, I am going to lose, I believe it would be very frustrating to be right here, right? Accordingly, validate it, Yuuyami. I will figure out the way to repair the floor during Woodland exploration—such meaning.</p>

<p>“Understood. Tomorrow we shall deepen our friendship with Rapha-san.”<br />
“Eh? What was that? Wah, I don’t want to deepen friendship with Yuuyami.”<br />
“Do you hate me?”<br />
“That’s not it. But, I’m just saying you are abominable opponent  who snatched onee-chama away  from me.”<br />
“That, I guess, generally, that can be considered you hate me.”<br />
“I was joking,” Rapha shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>However, for Rapha not laughing, that is  half a truth, guessed Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Well, then, can I go with Ohan?”</p>

<p>Lydia looked at Rapha with moist eyes.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Conversation not tying together.”<br />
“Is it no good?”</p>

<p>Lydia displayed a slightly qualm expression.<br />
Cute. Cute, in sooth. Yuuyami instantly grew an urge to  embrace Lydia tightly.</p>

<p>“Ah… eh…” Rapha was at loss for words.<br />
“Is it no good?”<br />
“After all, Ohan is my…”<br />
“Do you, hate me? Are you, being malicious to me?”<br />
“W, wah, I don’t hate you! I love onee-chama!”<br />
“I consider Rapha as cherished little sister…”<br />
“I’m cherishing onee-chama, too!”<br />
“Then, is that okay?”<br />
“…Please, return by the dusk.”</p>

<p>Rapha capitulated.<br />
Nevertheless,  Rapha rather tenacious  person, judged Yuuyami.<br />
If it was Yuuyami, upon the second “Is it no good?” she would crash headlong, instead of giving in.<br />
From the sky as though, where she is herself, to the ground, where is Lydia.<br />
That had been substantiated upon the hour of bath being built.</p>
