    <p>As they proceed deeper the Woodland,  quite soon Lydia lost a sense of direction.<br />
Despite daytime, Woodland was dim;  the atmosphere felt chilly as though. Furthermore, ground was bumpy that arduous to walk.<br />
Overall, such ominous place stimulated a human fear.<br />
Consequently, Lydia,</p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s haunted-!”</p>

<p>was being seized by a very cheerful mood.<br />
I cannot help but enjoy such. An unknown location. Unknown atmosphere. My pounding heart picks up the pace.</p>

<p>“Existence of phantoms has not been proved.”</p>

<p>Indifferently said Yuuyami.<br />
She was walking with her right hand linked to Lydia’s left, whereas the other hand made their way through​ the vegetation.<br />
Lydia is one step behind Yuuyami. However it was not since Yuuyami had her asked so.<br />
Before she knew it, that turned their disposition.<br />
Yet, Lydia understood a precise reason for such.<br />
Yuuyami willingly advancing forth, verifying whether there any harmful for Lydia plants.<br />
Accordingly, with no doubt, if Lydia were to come to the front, with, “Hey stop,” Yuuyami would pull Lydia behind.</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll be first person who’d prove existence of phantoms.”<br />
“Very well. But withal, what will you do so in order to prove it?”<br />
“Become friends.”<br />
“With a phantom?”<br />
“That’s right. Seems to be interesting.”<br />
“Indeed. Given that numerous individuals has committed suicide​s hereby, as such,  quite possible for phantoms to reside here.”<br />
“Suicide?”<br />
“Yes. People were killing themselves. So it became a famous place.”<br />
“Why?”</p>

<p>Tilted her head Lydia.</p>

<p>“The reason for why did it become a famous place? Or why humans were committing suicides?”<br />
“Each.”<br />
“Hmm. Famous place simply for many people chose this place to die.”<br />
“Surely, it’s nice place for such, not bad.”</p>

<p>Lydia said so, observing environments.</p>

<p>“<em>Not bad</em>?”<br />
“Such scene, not bad for the last moments of life. Also, the atmosphere is lovely, it feels like we grew one with nature, it’s not bad, uh-huh. I believe they had a good taste.”<br />
“As Lydia also be dying, that should be here?”<br />
“Mm—mm,” Lydia shook her head: “I must be embosomed by Yuuyami, you know?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami halted.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” asked Lydia.<br />
“No, that, I’m, a bit…”<br />
“Mm?”<br />
“…embarrassed.​”<br />
“Really? Show me your face?”<br />
“It’s normal now. We shall move forward.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami proceed walking again.</p>

<p>“Eh—? I wish I’ve seen–.”<br />
“If the opportunity shows itself.”<br />
“Oka—y.”</p>

<p>Replied Lydia, and the pair, for a while, continued their walk.</p>

<p>“Speaking of which,” says Lydia; “I haven’t hitherto heard why was they committing suicides, have I?”<br />
“Yes, you have not. However, honestly speaking, one cannot tell another’s motive until one would become them.”<br />
“I see. Well, I guess so.”</p>

<p>Therein rather numerous different reasons. So many as the people.</p>

<p>“Would you like to hear the most common​ reason?”<br />
“Mm—mm, no.”<br />
“Is that so?”<br />
“Uh-huh. Incidentally, I guess we already walked for nigh a kilometre, haven’t we?”<br />
“No. It has been as yet slightly over three hundred meters of our entering Woodland.”<br />
“Is that all?”<br />
“The Woodland is difficult to tread. Are you feeling fatigued?”<br />
“I’m alright.”<br />
“How far do you able to advance?”<br />
“Mn—, let’s turn beck at about five hundred meters. If we want to explore it properly, we might need a sleeping bag and the likes.”<br />
“I agree. We shall prepare the camp and perform another full-scaled expedition upon the next occasion.”<br />
“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>After that, walking under the silence, pair went beyond the point of four hundred meters.<br />
Albeit it being chilly enclosed by the Woodland, Lydia felt rather warm, inasmuch as she was on foot throughout the way.<br />
Lydia lowered a  slide fastener upon jacket, as such, uncovered her front. A simple white <em>cut and sew</em> grew visible from under her wrapping.</p>

<p>“Lydia.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami halted.</p>

<p>“What is it? Have you get embarrassed once again?”</p>

<p>Lydia stopped likewise.</p>

<p>“It’s different. There is…”</p>

<p>During saying that, Yuuyami drew Lydia forth, and placed  her beside.</p>

<p>“Human?”</p>

<p>Blonde female​ was being reflected within Lydia’s view.<br />
She was sitting leaned against the tree, having her eyes closed.</p>

<p>“It’s different.”</p>

<p>Upon peering closer, female was fairly muddy. Ragged, decayed clothes; as of exposed parts, there were seen dirty exfoliated artificial skin.</p>

<p>“Is she broken?”<br />
“I guess so. I believe it shall not  operate again.”<br />
“Can I approach her?”<br />
“Yes. It is okay.”</p>

<p>Lydia let go Yuuyami’s hand, and moved forth the female AD.<br />
By  features of female AD, her apparent age  is around eighteen years old, deemed Lydia.<br />
Throughout the time I’m seeing this AD, I feel, as though they are resembling myself in ways.<br />
Yuuyami also approached and stood next to Lydia.<br />
Suddenly gushing forth an unspeakable emotion, made Lydia slightly perplexed.<br />
Sadness as though, soreness as though, albeit​ she does not understand it well,  her heart turned mushy.<br />
Whereupon,<br />
<em>click</em>, female AD opened her eyes.<br />
Lydia had been startled, for that was so abrupt.<br />
Yuuyami snapped her eyes open likewise.</p>

<p>“Ojou-sama…” gazing up at Lydia, female AD says: “Apricot~, anytime…”</p>

<p>Female-type AD raised her arms in a sluggish movement.</p>

<p>“This child, moving?”<br />
“So it seems. Curious. In her condition, such appeared improbable.”</p>

<p><em>Hmm</em>,  displayed pondering gesture Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Anytime… anywhere… ready to make love…”<br />
“Ready to make love​?” tilted her head Lydia.<br />
“This child SA series,” says Yuuyami; “I guess she means you can have a sex with her at anytime.”<br />
“I see. But why she’s looking at me?”<br />
“Female-oriented, female-type SA series.”<br />
“Er?”<br />
“The series for feminine gender​ who can love only women; as well as the series for females wishing to have fun with another female.”<br />
“Ah-, that’s how it is–.”</p>

<p>Lydia nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>“Ojou-sama… do you love, Apricot~?”</p>

<p>Female-type of AD spread both of her lifted hands.<br />
Gesture signified either ‘Hug me’ or ‘Would you like to hug me’. Lydia was wavering however, unsure as of her further action, and sent a gaze at Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Recognising Lydia as her master conveying that this child has been initialised.”<br />
“Initialised?”<br />
“She is abandoned.”<br />
“In a Woodland?”<br />
“Yes.”</p>

<p>Once again, indescribable emotions overflowed Lydia.</p>

<p>“Can I hug her?”</p>

<p>Asked Lydia, whereas peering complexion of Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Guessing of that complex countenance, you believe I would turn angry​ at you for such?”<br />
“No—, I just wouldn’t want you-, to get angry–.”<br />
“It’s alright. However, this child could be abnormal.”<br />
“Please, help me if anything happens.”<br />
“Understood.”</p>

<p>Upon validation Yuuyami nods, Lydia pressed her knees against the ground.<br />
Whereafter, slowly moved her body towards the chest of female AD.</p>

<p>“You are Apricot?”<br />
“Uh-huh. Apricot~… is Apricot. Ojou-sama… warm… Apricot~, happy…”</p>

<p>Female-type AD— Apricot, gently wrapped her arms around Lydia’s back.<br />
The hug felt almost powerless. Not for she was gentle, however, but for she has no strength  left, reached a conclusion Lydia.</p>

<p>“Say-, Yuuyami…”<br />
“Shall I guess?”<br />
“Eh?”<br />
“This child-, I would like to save her-; right?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami exaggeratedly imitated Lydia’s tone.</p>

<p>“Do I speak like that?”<br />
“Yes. So my conjecture is correct?”<br />
“It’s correct-, but that’s a bit–.”</p>

<p>Lydia grew a deep breath.<br />
Upon that time, Apricot quivered.<br />
With following,</p>

<p>“Ah-, Ojou-sama’s, breath… feels, good.”</p>

<p>Apricot let out a wet voice.<br />
Suddenly, Lydia felt somewhat embarrassed. I do not understand it well, but embarrassed anyway.</p>

<p>“Well, then, Lydia, please take a backpack. I shall carry this child upon my back.”</p>

<p>Having no insight for condition of Lydia’s heart, Yuuyami bring down her backpack.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh! That’s good idea! Uh-huh!”</p>

<p>Hurriedly separating from Apricot, Lydia picked up the backpack.</p>

<p>“What is wrong? Your face is scarlet red? Appears that your body temperature slightly rose up. Heartbeat also being…”<br />
“It’s different! Different, you know!? I’m fine, okay!?”</p>

<p>Flustered Lydia waved her hands.</p>

<p>“Is that so?”<br />
“So that is!”</p>

<p>Upon saying such, Lydia took a deep breath.<br />
Yuuyami brings Apricot upon her back.</p>

<p>“Ojou-sama is nice…”</p>

<p>Murmured Apricot.</p>

<p>“Lydia has a crush. Hence, this is impossible. Please keep quiet and stay upon my back.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami was not indifferent any more. The mood, the tone, were somewhat sulky.</p>

<p>“U, um, Yuuyami?”</p>

<p>Under the great surprise, Lydia called her out.</p>

<p>“What is it? Please stay close diligently.”</p>

<p><em>Swoosh</em>, Yuuyami begins to walk.</p>

<p>“You aren’t angry​?”</p>

<p>Asked Lydia, during chasing after Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“I am not.”<br />
“Really?”<br />
“Yes. Perhaps. However, at present I am as yet studying emotions of myself.”<br />
“This, probably anger, you know?”<br />
“Why am I should to be angry?”<br />
“Eh? That’s probably, err….”<br />
“<em>Err</em>?”<br />
“Since my heart pounding over Apricot… and, Yuuyami recognised it?”<br />
“Oh-. Thus, the reason is jealousy.”<br />
“Um. Either it, or anger, which accompanies jealousy.”<br />
“I see, I see. I’m jealous right now. As such, perhaps, even angry.”<br />
“S, sorry?”<br />
“Yes. I shall forgive you. Nevertheless, if you repair Apricot, please, do not flirt with her too much.”<br />
“I would never! Only with Yuuyami!”<br />
“I believe you. And, slightly embarrassed.”<br />
“Really? Show me your face? Show me your face—”</p>

<p>Lydia attempt to take a roundabout path so to be before Yuuyami; however, Yuuyami altered her direction of her tread, and maliciously did not introduced her visage.<br />
Concluding it, Yuuyami remarked, “Now that is called a payback,” wearing a smile upon her features. <br />
I guess such must be done before forgiving, wondered Lydia.<br />
But well-, seems as though I restored her good mood,   Lydia   smiled lightly.</p>
