    <p>Lady, who invited Lydia to the lodge, introduced herself as Hinagiku.<br />
At present, Lydia sitting upon one-person sofa. For Hinagiku said, ‘I’ll fetch a drink,’ she withdrew to within the house.<br />
Incidentally, Ohan awaiting outside.<br />
Lydia restlessly peered over the lodge.<br />
Lodge is very simple and frugal. There were bare minimum, necessary for life.<br />
That is: sofa, table, and bed.<br />
Along with, probably, a simple Food Maker and Recycling Box, which placed within depth of the dwelling, speculated Lydia.<br />
Lodge ceiling is awfully tall, and, being Ohan to get through the entrance, he would be able rise inside.<br />
Upon Lydia swam her gaze to the table, she found an  emerald green sphere locked up in the vial.<br />
Lydia tilted her head.<br />
What is this-?<br />
For her never seen before that kind of object, Lydia gathered the tablet from her backpack, which  placed upon the floor, took a picture of vial with its camera, and searched it up.<br />
The hit was a cultivation method of growing moss, denoted as terrarium.</p>

<p>“He-,” Lydia nods. “Isn’t it cramped?”</p>

<p>Upon that questioning, Lydia put a tablet on the table.<br />
Moss grew no reply.<br />
Well, of course. Vegetation​ have mere primitive consciousness, thence they would not respond to human language.<br />
Hinagiku returned, placing a coffee cup at the table.</p>

<p>“It’s <em>café au lait</em>.”<br />
“Thank you. I like <em>café au lait</em>.”</p>

<p>Lydia silently regarded over Hinagiku.<br />
By eye, Hinagiku appeared to be in the middle of her twenties. Adult female. Her hair black, and is casually tied up. Pupils of identical to hair hue.<br />
Hinagiku has a harmonised features, they, however, have not much of expression, leaving, thus,  a slightly cold impression.<br />
Pale skin, the body was feeble, rather than slender, and appeared exceedingly unhealthy.<br />
Hinagiku bore a white coat. A coat akin the one of lab worker.<br />
Nevertheless, she doesn’t seem to research anything at this lodge.</p>

<p>“Is that so. You like  <em>café au lait</em>​?”<br />
“Uh-huh. Say-, Hinagiku, why are you living here alone?”<br />
“Is there other places to live?”<br />
“For the world is destroyed?”<br />
“Well, yes.”<br />
“Hm–.”</p>

<p>Lydia took a sip of <em>café au lait</em>. That tasted a little distinct of the <em>café au lait</em>​ I usually drink at the library.</p>

<p>“<em>Lydia</em>, was it?”<br />
“Uh-huh. I am Lydia. Nice to meet you.”<br />
“Aha- What’s Lydia doing here?”<br />
“Exploration.”<br />
“Exploration? What of?”<br />
“The world.”<br />
“Is that so. You investigating the places of the world that are, and are not remain?”<br />
“Well, something of the sort.”</p>

<p>To be honest, may be closer to say that I commenced it out of curiosity, rather than expressing it as proper research.<br />
Silence.<br />
Hinagiku kept standing, and quietly staring down at Lydia.<br />
Lydia averted her eyes. She didn’t know the reason, but felt Hinagiku’s gaze was not very good as though.</p>

<p>“Apropos,” broke the silence Lydia, without making an eye contact: “was this house built after the world’s collapse?”<br />
“No. It’s been here since before the decay. This is my hideaway.”<br />
“I see. Somehow it seemed like a fresh house.”<br />
“I am performing a proper maintenance. I have nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>During the exchange, Lydia felt something being out of place.<br />
Wondering over what that was, I intimately examined the present conversation.</p>

<p>“Hinagiku, right now, what is your age?”</p>

<p>The source of discomfort is the age of Hinagiku. If she was the owner of this place in prior of the world’s collapse, her age did not match.</p>

<p>“I haven’t count. However, I think, it’s about fifty.”<br />
“Fifty!?”</p>

<p>She doesn’t appear to be, by all means.</p>

<p>“Aha- I haven’t count, so maybe more,” Hinagiku bent her neck. “I stopped growing now. It’s  by-product  of my project.”<br />
“Is that so?”<br />
“Aha- I don’t wish to grow old and rot away. I’m a person who has been praised for being close to god. I can’t bear the sight of approaching death.”<br />
“Close to god?”<br />
“I produced humans. No sexual intercourse. Furthermore, an outstanding​ human beings. I named them a new humans breed.”<br />
“I heard… that… I have.”</p>

<p>Weird. Lydia turned drowsy rapidly. Without knowing a  reason. Consciousness, however, growing vague.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a lot of chatter when you wake up, cute Lucy.”<br />
“Who…”</p>

<p>Who are you?<br />
Albeit wishing to ask, I cannot assemble  the words.<br />
Eyelids dropped, and her consciousness  faded away.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Lydia was within the dream world.<br />
An infinite, peach-coloured​ room. Where is impossible to divide which is the top and which the bottom. Albeit I believe to standing somewhere, no ground can be found anywhere.<br />
It’s been a very long time since I felt thus.</p>

<p>“Iris, where are you-?”</p>

<p>Bustling about, Lydia  observed her surroundings.</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>The violet​ iris greatly swayed under Lydia’s feet.</p>

<p>“It’s you after all.”<br />
“Yea.  Ourself, after all.”<br />
“Have you came to fulfil my love again?”<br />
“Different. Thy amour nigh fulfilled. Appears though ye got married, so for thou that is unnecessary. We came for thy primal purpose.”<br />
“What is the purpose?”<br />
“Can not utter yet. Howbeit ourself believes upon the hour of our next contact, ourself shalt be able to preach thou.”<br />
“Is that so?”<br />
“So that is.”</p>

<p>Blank. Not a silence but blankness. Akin a crevice of the life, a short, blank space flowed in.<br />
Suddenly, Lydia recognised her circumstances.</p>

<p>“Am I, asleep?”<br />
“Quite so. Sweven. Thuris ourself can meet thou. Upon thou wake up, however, thou once again shalt hast an assignment ahead.”<br />
“I see. Apropos, are you prepared to this?”<br />
“No. Thyself, that is imposed  to thou.”<br />
“Why to me?”<br />
“Sith thuris is bound to.”<br />
“Understood. So? You are going to give me some hint again, aren’t you? Since I am cute.”<br />
“Right. For thou art cute.”</p>

<p>Iris lightly shook, laughed as though.</p>

<p>“Tell me.”</p>

<p><em>Slump</em>, Lydia flops down upon the spot.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Ourself shalt teach thou. ‘Upon thou perceive <em>that</em>, assignment is culminates.’”<br />
“What should I realise?”<br />
“Ourself can not utter as much. It is uncomplicated, however. Such shalt grew concluded afore long. Thereupon, it reaches a nigh perfection. It is akin a validation on existing of issues.”<br />
“Is that so?”<br />
“Yea. Well, then, we hast ceased.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Although​ I’m not sure I understand it well, still, I understand. Thank you, good-bye.”<br />
“Ah- See you, Lydia.”</p>

<p>Lydia raised her right hand, Iris  swayed from side to side.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>When Lydia woke up, she was in cage.<br />
Its perimeter roughly two meters long, wide, and deep.<br />
She surrounded from all four sides and from top with iron bars, which are completely dividing the outside and the inside. Lydia is inside, and the outside being a chamber, the lodge, whereat she was drinking <em>café au lait</em> a while ago.<br />
Lydia stood up and checked her body. No injuries to be seen, no feeling of discomfort either. She, however, was not dressed.<br />
Nude Lydia deprived of her wearable likewise.<br />
Taking into account functioning air conditioner, the air is clean and not chilly.<br />
I am simply imprisoned, understood the girl.<br />
But if I call Ohan, I can leave immediately.</p>

<p>“Hinagiku, where are you?”</p>

<p>Lydia lightly touched one of the iron bars.<br />
Upon that instant,</p>

<p>“Ow, hurts!!”</p>

<p>a furious shock-wave hit Lydia.<br />
Lydia anxiously verified her hand - it did not fade away. Is properly attached. With no visible damage.<br />
What was the pain from before, Lydia was perplexed.</p>

<p>“It’s a stun gauge.”</p>

<p>The voice of Hinagiku was audible from behind.<br />
Lydia turned around; sitting upon one-person sofa Hinagiku with a glass in hand, was peering at Lydia.</p>

<p>“If you aren’t masochist, Lucy, I advice you not to touch it.”<br />
“Stun gauge?”<br />
“Electric current flowing through the bars. Thus, it’s stun gauge.”<br />
“Why electric current flowing through?”<br />
“Ah-, Lucy. Cute Lucy. I didn’t wish to do this.”<br />
“Despite you done it.”<br />
“Aha-, yes. Indeed. I don’t want to hurt Lucy. I just don’t want to lose you. And wishing to see you naked. That’s all.”<br />
“Naked?”<br />
“Ah- Nice view. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen an actual girl naked.”</p>

<p>Stated Hinagiku, wearing a grave expression.</p>

<p>“…Is, is that so…”<br />
“However don’t get me wrong. I’m not fine with everyone.”<br />
“Who would be fine?”<br />
“You, Lucy.”<br />
“Is that limited to only myself?”<br />
“Well, it’s not limited.”<br />
“I see. I’m not the only one.”</p>

<p>For it to be Yuuyami, Lydia would receive a special treatment.</p>

<p>“I love you, Lucy.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, Hinagiku declared thus.</p>

<p>“Despite a moment ago you said I wasn’t special!?”</p>

<p>For love confession, timing is the worst.</p>

<p>“Basically, if that’s a beautiful girl, everyone would love her?”<br />
“That means any beautiful girl would be fine!? It’s dreadful frivolousness!”<br />
“It can’t be that way. I’m sincere.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku gulped down the liquid from the glass.</p>

<p>“A sincere frivolousness!”</p>

<p>I can’t keep up with the meaning any more, thought Lydia.</p>

<p>“Hm…”</p>

<p>Hinagiku touched a chin with right hand, pondering over it.</p>

<p>“W, well, that’s fine, could you  get me out the stun gauge?”</p>

<p>Lydia is neither pet nor criminal. No reason for her to be imprisoned in the cage.</p>

<p>“No.”<br />
“At any price?”<br />
“No, at any price.”<br />
“I see.”</p>

<p>Lydia sighed.<br />
After that, she still hesitated whether to call Ohan.<br />
If Lydia call him, she will be saved. In front of Ohan, something akin a stun gauge has not much of difference from a cardboard box.<br />
However, supposing Ohan recognises Hinagiku as an enemy?<br />
Terrifying even to assume it.<br />
Nevertheless, if they can understand language, firstly always goes a warning. Accordingly, if Hinagiku obey at that time, no problems shall occur.<br />
It is unknown, however, if Hinagiku would docilely obey.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you call Ohan?” asked Hinagiku.<br />
“It’s dangerous for Hinagiku, so I will not.”<br />
“How kind of you, Lucy. However Ohan, that accompanied Lucy, was originally mine.”<br />
“Eh?”<br />
“And since my admin’s authority remained. Give me a moment.”</p>

<p>Standing up, Hinagiku placed her glass upon the floor, and picked something from behind the sofa and carried it.</p>

<p>“My authority should have been erased.”</p>

<p>What Hinagiku held,</p>

<p>“It was not, so Ohan listened to my order.”</p>

<p>was similar to torn off with a great force,</p>

<p>“An order, to destroy himself.”</p>

<p>Ohan’s head.<br />
Such an egregious order— Losing her strength, Lydia flopped down.</p>
