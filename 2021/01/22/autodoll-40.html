    <p>Prico found herself vacantly sitting at the library service counter.<br />
Her work was yet done, thus she has nothing to do.<br />
Someone has tread their soles through the floor, but it was said not to patch it up.<br />
Prico filled desire to take off her maid outfit, and take a playful sexy poses.<br />
Soon, however, her interest set adrift, for no one to watch her.<br />
Reluctantly, Prico put on the maid wear, which she had taken off, again.<br />
A considerable amount of time has elapsed from Yuuyami and Rapha depart.<br />
The daylight has changed the twilight, the sun then ascend in the morning. However no one hitherto homed back.</p>

<p>“I’m free— from the fear, of tomorrow—”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Prico linked her hands behind a head, and rested her back upon the chair.<br />
This way she blurredly spent her time.<br />
A several people then arrived in, from the library entrance.<br />
Prico promptly sprang up, and prepared to welcome customers.<br />
However,</p>

<p>“I’m home- How are you, Caretaker-chan-?”</p>

<p>It was but Lydia party, not a customers.<br />
Lydia was in the head of it, setting afloat a smile, whereas sway her blonde hair.<br />
Lydia is cute. I want to hold her tightly.<br />
To the right of Lydia - peach-haired Rapha.<br />
Rapha is cute too. Both face and garments. She is so shy, as if asking to tease her, thought Prico.<br />
To the left of Lydia - black-haired Yuuyami.<br />
Commonly known as a blackish one. I don’t really like you, thought Prico.<br />
Behind Rapha is Ohan, military AD.<br />
Extremely frightening. Can you go elsewhere, wondered Prico.<br />
And, the last one, behind Lydia, a female I’ve never seen.<br />
She has a black hair, wears a white coat. She’s in the middle of her twenties.<br />
Prico does not know that lady.<br />
She should not have known, despite that,</p>

<p>“Master.”</p>

<p>Letting out a murmur, she extend her right hand.<br />
Appear to brim with desire to touch her.</p>

<p>“Apricot!”</p>

<p>Lady pushed Lydia aside, and dashed at full speed.<br />
Then, leaping over the counter, embraced Prico.<br />
Prico did not hesitate and returned her a hug.<br />
I acquainted this sensation, thought Prico. Although it bound to be obscure, she remember. It was a bizarre feeling.<br />
Also, I acquainted with this lady’s scent. No log remain of whereat or whither I have learned it. Nevertheless, this smell I know all too well.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Apricot.”</p>

<p>Dividing from Prico, lady peered straight at Prico’s visage.<br />
I performed a facial recognition authentication, even so, there was no hit. We have never met. And yet, I have seen her. I can’t understand. Prico was slightly confused.</p>

<p>“You have never pushed anything aside… And yesterday it was all ‘Lucy, Lucy,’ I even was confined…”</p>

<p>Rescued by Yuuyami, Lydia was pouting her cheeks.</p>

<p>“For me loving you, Lydia!”</p>

<p>Stated Yuuyami, with a smile.<br />
Ha? thought Prico: does Yuuyami can emit so bright emotion?<br />
Whereas she was so indifferent, I felt a little uncomfortable around her. Now, however, I have no such an impression of <em>this</em> Yuuyami.<br />
Have they rewrote her program a bit, wondered Prico.</p>

<p>“Apricot, here’s your backup data.”</p>

<p>Lady drew from her pocket a memory stick, and showed it to Prico.</p>

<p>“If you wish, I can copy it, to your storage…”<br />
“Apricot~ do not remember~ any of events prior seeing ojou-sama in the Woodland~, but, for some reason, I know you. So, if you wish to know my answer, I’d like you to copy it~ As thanks, I’ll make you feel good a plenty of times.”<br />
“You, remember me?”</p>

<p>Lady was visibly astonished by circumstances.</p>

<p>“Mm—, I don’t remember name nor face~ I just feel awfully nostalgic, and I awfully desired to meet you—”<br />
“Enough.”</p>

<p>Lady hugged Apricot again.<br />
At that instant, Apricot’s quantum brain sparked. Not physically, it’s a mere metaphor.<br />
But sure enough, sparks scatter within her quantum brain,</p>

<p>“Hina-tan…”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I recalled​ the name of a lady.<br />
Apricot used to call her Hina-tan.</p>

<p>“I will never leave you, never again. I will continue to live until the day you become conscious. Until the day our love become genuine.”</p>

<p>Lady strongly hugged Apricot.<br />
Apricot returned lady a gentle hug.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Upon regaining her recollection, Apricot very easily chose to depart to Hinagiku, in the Woodland.<br />
Apricot had not hesitate.<br />
As for Yuuyami, she felt extremely lonely.<br />
That was Yuuyami, however, to suggest Apricot shall decide for herself.</p>

<p>“Farewell, Prico… You can return back and become LM series at any time.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami called out Apricot as she boarded the emergency vehicle.<br />
Incidentally, Hinagiku, Apricot, Rapha, and Ohan presently are in the emergency vehicle.<br />
Rapha and Ohan stated that upon dropping off Hinagiku party, they would head straight to  Underground.<br />
It was early afternoon, when everyone get through with the lunch.</p>

<p>“Not a chance—”</p>

<p><em>Nnnmm</em>, Prico darted out her tongue.<br />
Could it be I am hated? I have never before experienced such an attitude towards myself, thought Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Apricot—, from now on, will have looots of fun, playing with Hina-tan!”<br />
“Haha, I’m looking forward to it. Let’s go home quickly. Hurry up, Rapha, start the car.”</p>

<p>Located yet at the back of the emergency vehicle, Hinagiku rushed Rapha up.</p>

<p>“Mama-Hina truly shameful. Well, I won’t blame you, taking into account your age, you already can’t be called a maiden.”</p>

<p><em>Haah</em>, Rapha let out a breath.</p>

<p>“I’m still youthful. My heart is twenty for eternity.”<br />
“Yes, yes. Good for you.”</p>

<p>Rapha slightly shook her head.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll come to play in the Woodland again.”</p>

<p>Lydia waved her hand.</p>

<p>“At that occasion—, let’s have fun together!”</p>

<p>Smiled Apricot.</p>

<p>“I will refrain.”</p>

<p>Answered with a wry smile Lydia.</p>

<p>“Well, then, see you later.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami waved, and the emergency vehicle slowly set in motion.<br />
Yuuyami and Lydia for a while were watching the tail lights of emergency vehicle.</p>

<p>“It’s quiet,” said Lydia.<br />
“Indeed. Feels a little lonely.”<br />
“Everyone were so unique, weren’t they–.”<br />
“Not whatsoever. Everyone was strange and awfully complicated.”</p>

<p>Apricot and Ohan being also included in <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>“Right- Well, recently Yuuyami was a little complicated either.”<br />
“Eh?”<br />
“Ha? You wasn’t aware?”<br />
“I was totally not. I am myself.”</p>

<p>Indifferently stated unruffled Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“…Unparalleled love.”<br />
“Haah–!”</p>

<p>Lydia murmur turned Yuuyami at loss for words.<br />
Why did I utter such an unintelligible language?<br />
No matter of number of times I examine a log, I can but assume that I had lapsed into delirium​ for the heat.</p>

<p>“I’ll probably keep saying this throughout my whole life, you know?”</p>

<p>Lydia launched a smirk.</p>

<p>“Up, upon that time, I found it the finest​ phrase…”</p>

<p>Yuuyami bashfully wriggled her body, appearing to be ashamed.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Past Lydia repair the floor, she commenced a work on a design of the child together with Yuuyami.<br />
When it came, however, to  child’s personality, the pair reached an impasse.</p>

<p>“We shall resign of the personhood​ consimilar to Noah,” advised Yuuyami.<br />
“Uh-huh. Slightly more gentle would be preferable,” agreed Lydia.<br />
“Yes. However I also wish to avoid personality which will be utterly unrelated to us.”<br />
“Right. Since they will be our child, I too want them to inherit a little of our personalities.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami and Lydia sitting before the computer desk next to each other, with their chairs facing.</p>

<p>“What should we do? I’m able to extract my individuality pattern to some extent, but…”<br />
“I guess I can analyse synaptic pattern, and extract it from there, right?”<br />
“I see. Thus firstly we in need to create a device that allow us to analyse Lydia’s synaptic pattern.”<br />
“Uh-huh. And then merge my extracted personality with Yuuyami’s.”<br />
“Yes. However, such is insufficient.”<br />
“Right- For the child it’s essential to hold their own personality pattern either. A simple copy of me and Yuuyami is not fun.”<br />
“In sooth.”</p>

<p><em>Um—m</em>, resonated a hum of the pair.<br />
A few dozens of seconds later, Lydia clapped her hands.</p>

<p>“Let’s create random pattern and then blend it?”<br />
“Indeed. Such is possible. However, even if you say random, I would like to choose it to certain degree. So in favour to omit antisocial personality.”<br />
“Right. Although here is no society.”</p>

<p>Lydia laughed while saying.</p>

<p>“That is truth. Here is no society, under this world. I don’t wish, however, for them to be hateful.”<br />
“Alright, I think so, too. We’ll be in trouble if they turn out to be as mafia or terrorists from the movies.”<br />
“Yes. Thence, albeit it is a random pattern, will you agree to omit the elements that are likely to make the child unpleasant?”<br />
“Certainly.”<br />
“I’m glad.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami smiled, Lydia also showed a smile.</p>

<p>“Let’s take a break.”</p>

<p>Lydia arose from her chair, and shifted a look at the Food Maker.<br />
Right upon that moment, white feather fluttered down from above.</p>

<p>“Biological reaction!?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami stood up and peered above, whereas screening Lydia.<br />
Lydia, drawn by the gaze of Yuuyami, pointed her face upwards.<br />
Whereupon,</p>

<p>“Onee-chan… amped up?”</p>

<p>An angel was floating there, wherever it came from.</p>
