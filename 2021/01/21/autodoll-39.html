    <p>Yuuyami placed Lydia, who she was carrying, down, removed her maid outfit, and laid it out over the ground.<br />
Lydia took off her boots, sat upon the maid outfit, and attempt to undress.</p>

<p>“No, don’t. I shall do it myself.”</p>

<p>Remarked Yuuyami, whereas bringing herself down, before Lydia.<br />
Immediately whereafter, she started up a software to allow herself feel pleasure. This is, of course, a software for SA series, it was not initially installed in Yuuyami.<br />
Lydia intently observed the Yuuyami’s body.<br />
Yuuyami had already reproduced necessary organs, and had undergone physical remodelling.<br />
Lydia received a  soft kiss from Yuuyami. A light kiss that merely touched their lips.<br />
Tactile sensor of Yuuyami perceived the tenderness​ and the warmth of Lydia. Up to this point, the actions appear same as usual.<br />
And is feels exceedingly​ good. Joyful. My heart experience a pleasant warmness. This is also usual state.<br />
At present, however, that I has started the software up, such furnish myself with a pleasant sensation; along with, withal, an electrical stimulation that circulate throughout the body of Yuuyami.<br />
Yuuyami expect such would happen, nevertheless was amazed, for excitement being far beyond her expectations, she parted her lips thus.<br />
Upon peering at Lydia, the reflection of Yuuyami could be spotted within her moist pupils.<br />
Ah-, I’m enclosed by Lydia— thought to herself Yuuyami. With following, ‘What a wonderful notion,’ interpretation.<br />
Yuuyami kisses her again.<br />
This time, whilst kissing intensely and deeply, I was smoothly taking off Lydia’s jacket and tee shirt.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami, good, at striping me…”</p>

<p>Wet voice. Different from the usual Lydia.<br />
Yuuyami perceived a furious pulsation, her metal frame as though being torn apart. This is, the love upon a verge of insanity. The one that brim with longing for Lydia.<br />
It was a very strong emotion, if I had a heart it would undoubtedly ruptured. Hence, Yuuyami thought, how great that I have none.<br />
In addition to that, withal, I grew anxious over Lydia’s heart condition.<br />
However, if the sensor of Yuuyami  functioning normally, there is no signs of Lydia’s heart break down. Her heart beat faster than usual, however it is acceptable.<br />
Yuuyami placed her hand upon Lydia’s modest breast, and gently fondled it.<br />
Watching Lydia’s expression and listening to her voice, Yuuyami gradually intensified the stimulation.</p>

<p>“I also, will assault…”</p>

<p>Lydia laid her hand upon Yuuyami’s bosom, and tenderly massaged it.<br />
Yuuyami was hit by a tempest​ of electrical stimulation.<br />
The sensation was not unpleasant. Rather, was arousing​ enough to grew habitual.<br />
A thought that AD of SA series doing this on regular basis, made Yuuyami feel slightly envious.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>As Noah was vacantly loitered nigh the Woodland, the life-form was caught by their sensor.<br />
Creature flapped its large wings, and flew down from the sky.</p>

<p>“No way, angel descend?”</p>

<p>Excepting the wings upon its back, creature has a shape of the girl.<br />
Around fifteen of age, calculating by her development.</p>

<p>“Hey… bored?”</p>

<p>Asked the Angel, rising beside of Noah.</p>

<p>“It’s boring to death. I’ve been left on-line again.”<br />
“Right… Good. Since Mika also has… a time to spare.”<br />
“What? Did you break a pact with God?”<br />
“Mm—mm.”</p>

<p>Angel shook her head.</p>

<p>“So, you, like, had something to do at spare time, but that was cancelled, right?”<br />
“Uh-huh. You are… wise.”<br />
“That’s right. I’m recognised by  myself  and society as the best bike in the world.”<br />
“Right.”</p>

<p>Angel let out a short giggle.</p>

<p>“I’m Noah. Nice to meet you, Angel-chan. I thought angels were imaginary creatures.”<br />
“Nice to meet you, too… Mika, came… to see onee-chan.”<br />
“Oh. And then?”<br />
“Mama, and chibi-onee-chan, were there as well, so, Mika thought, why no…”<br />
“Mm-hmm.”<br />
“But… timing was bad…”<br />
“How is it?”<br />
“Onee-chan… in the middle of <em>ecchi</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> with her lover…”<br />
“Aw… that is, bad timing.”<br />
“So Mika free.”<br />
“Right, right. By the way, Angel-chan is <em>Mika</em>, right?”<br />
“Uh-huh… Mika is Mika.”</p>

<p>Familiar name, thought Noah. So Noah performed a search.<br />
Having done that, the name was found within action log.<br />
Thus, deducing a most logical conclusion:</p>

<p>“By any chance, is​ your onee-chan - Lydiko?”<br />
“Uh-huh. Nicely, grasped.”<br />
“Well, now. Does that means, Lydiko now uniting with Yuuyami-san? Damn, I’m jealous.”</p>

<p>No one had contacted Noah from the time they brought Yuuyami and Rapha to Woodland, so Noah was anxious over everyone.<br />
Therefore, I’m glad they are safe, thought Noah.</p>

<p>“Uniting… Lydiyami…”</p>

<p>Said Angel to herself, with a giggle.</p>

<p>“Sounds good. I’ll use it when I’d need to call Lydiko and Yuuyami-san together.”<br />
“Lydiyami… Fufu.”<br />
“Surely it’s a good name, but is it <em>so</em> amusing?”<br />
“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>Deeply nodded Angel.</p>

<p>“Hmm. Well, okay. Now, how about driving until Lydiyami-san’s <em>ecchi</em> is over?”<br />
“Ah, Mika meet… onee-chan… another time.”<br />
“I see. Do you want me to pass a  message?”<br />
“Mm—mm, it’s okay. Mika will come, to see them again, when Apricot’s case, will be solved.”<br />
“I see. Well, then, see you soon.”<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>Angel tilted her head.</p>

<p>“By the flow of your speech I though you were about to head home.”<br />
“Mika won’t go… Let’s drive.”<br />
“Oh- Riding, then.”</p>

<p>Whereat Noah said that, Angel “Yo-heave-ho!” mounted Noah.<br />
Sensation of Angel’s buttocks​ was tender and superb.</p>

<p>“After all, if one’ll board a cute girl on me, the tension will arise.”<br />
“Amped up.”<br />
“Oh- Amped up.”</p>

<p>Noah alter the direction, sliding a rear wheel.</p>

<p>“Alrighty, how far we’ll be riding?”<br />
“Until the morning.”</p>

<p>Noah asked in terms of location, Angel, however, answered time-wise.<br />
Well, such is no real issue.</p>

<p>“Roger that. Idling until the morning?”<br />
“Ya—”</p>

<p>Noah slowly started off, and gradually increased velocity.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“It felt so good, I thought I will die.”</p>

<p>Said yet nude Lydia, whereas embracing Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Me also.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami hasn’t been dressed likewise. Yuuyami’s clothes,  in the first place, were laid underneath their bodies.</p>

<p>“This also, but now,” says Lydia: “I can see why the purpose had changed.”<br />
“Indeed. With this kind of pleasure, I would like to execute it for something otherwise than perpetuation of descendants.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Say, can we do it from time to time?”<br />
“It’s alright. I can do it every day.”</p>

<p>Declared Yuuyami, with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“For my stamina, that’s a little…”</p>

<p>Albeit it feels good, the fatigue is extraordinary.<br />
At the end of such <em>every day</em>, I would look like a dead leaf, believed Lydia.</p>

<p>“I see. That is right. It cannot be helped.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami cast her eyes downward, in disappointment.</p>

<p>“Now, now, we have to design a child as soon as we return to the library.”<br />
“Indeed. For our intention​ was to make a child, was it not? This time.”<br />
“Right. This time.”</p>

<p>From next time, it will be for our own benefit.<br />
For if we would produce a child whenever having sex, library will be overflowed with children in a few years.</p>

<p>“Fifth generation AD, C series,” said Yuuyami.<br />
“Uh-huh. Tentative name - Shii-chan.”<br />
“Shii-chan?”<br />
“Child in need of tentative name. Until they sprout awareness and decide on their own name.”<br />
“I like the names you give, Lydia.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Names are important.”<br />
“Yes. I guess so.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami used not to attach much an importance to names.<br />
However now it’s different. Yuuyami glad to become Yuuyami from the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s head back to the lodge? Hinagiku and others might be worried.”<br />
“That’s right. It’s sooo regrettable, however cannot be helped.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami cast her eyes downwards, letting out a light sigh.<br />
Lydia clean off the soil afore putting a clothes, which she had left untidy, back on.<br />
The underwear, however, was stowed away in a jacket pocket.<br />
I hesitated to wear them, such will be like leaping into the pond.</p>
