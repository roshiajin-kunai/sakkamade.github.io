    <p>Angel lightly flew down, placing its feet upon the floor.<br />
Age of the angel was around fifteen, its emerald-green hair bundled up on the right side.</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>Asked Yuuyami, appearing to be wary.<br />
Lydia, however, wasn’t particularly vigilant. Peeking at its face from behind of Yuuyami, ‘What are you doing with the wings when it’s time to sleep?’ were her thoughts.</p>

<p>“I am… Michael. Yuuyami, and onee-chan. The two of you… amped up?”</p>

<p>Lightly giggled  Angel.</p>

<p>“Michael you say… Mika perhaps?”</p>

<p>Asked Lydia, popping forth from behind of Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Third・Tenmoku of Angel Project… Little sister, of yours, onee-chan.”<br />
“Despite you little sister, your development​ greater than mine!?”</p>

<p>Said Lydia, whereas observing Mika’s chest.<br />
The bulge was clearly larger than Lydia’s.</p>

<p>“Because Mika was… the latest… successful work.”<br />
“It’s like I’m a failure… Well, maybe a bit of failure…”</p>

<p>Lydia let out a mild sigh, as she cast a gaze upon her own chest.</p>

<p>“Such sort of thing is irrelevant,” confidently stated Yuuyami; “I like Lydia’s <em>chippai</em>.”<br />
“<em>Chippai</em>!?”<br />
“It is a short form for <em>chiisai oppai</em>.”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br />
“Uh-huh, I figured as much, though? And although I figured, I don’t like it!”<br />
“You don’t? I consider it an enormously easy-to-understand from.”<br />
“That’s right! I think you’re right! But I don’t like it!”<br />
“I see. Then let us not say it any more.”<br />
“Now, now,” Mika showed her palms to the pair; “because, your parent, Hina, is <em>chippai</em>, after all.”<br />
“Don’t say <em>chippai</em>–!”</p>

<p>Lydia stomped upon the spot.</p>

<p>“Let us leave subject apropos the chest for the time being,” suggested Yuuyami. “Why are you here, Mika-san? How did you get in here, to begin with?”<br />
“The reason… why does little sister wish to meet onee-chan?”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
“…I see. Here… Well, Mika, came here, wishing to talk with onee-chan. It seems, a various things, has settled down… and since Aki-chan, too, says that it’s okay to go.”<br />
“Aki-chan?”</p>

<p>Lydia tilted her head.</p>

<p>“Ah, let’s see, Iris, the flower…”<br />
“Are you acquainted?”</p>

<p>Said Yuuyami, in surprise.<br />
Lydia was surprised as well.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Because Mika, Aki-chan’s assistant…”<br />
“Assistant, what does it denotes?”<br />
“Helping, with the work…”<br />
“Yes. I understand as much. It is not…”<br />
“What is this Iris-flower in the first place?”</p>

<p>Asked Lydia, interrupting the words of Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“‘That’s what onee-chan will discover… after the last task…’  said Aki-chan.”<br />
“I see- To find out the true form of Iris, right?”</p>

<p>Lydia’s mood turned rather merry.<br />
It’s enjoyable to explore the unknown. I was already considered to attempt to unravel the truth regarding the Iris.<br />
Albeit, for I was buried under various projects and explorations, it was postponed.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Then… once you find the true identity, the two must go dream, together, Iris asked.”<br />
“Which <em>two</em>?”</p>

<p>Questioned Yuuyami; Mika pointed at Lydia, and then at Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Dream together, a Dream Server?”<br />
“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>Upon Mika nod, Lydia was convinced.<br />
Iris provide a cue for the Dream Server not for mere help to Yuuyami.<br />
Perhaps this is the first choice of Iris.<br />
The milestone for Yuuyami and Lydia to meet Iris together.</p>

<p>“I’m motivated! Yuuyami, let us identify the true form of Iris without a delay?”<br />
“Alright.”<br />
“No good,” says Mika; “You have to make a child first… Aki-chan, will go afterwards.”<br />
“Eh? Is that so?”<br />
“Uh-huh. Aki-chan, said… so.”<br />
“I see. Understood. Well, then, let us produce a child firstly, but before that.”</p>

<p>Lydia stared at Mika.<br />
Mika slightly bent her neck.</p>

<p>“Mika, did you destroy the world?”</p>

<p>Straightforwardly  asked Lydia. I am not good with roundabout technique.</p>

<p>“Yeah—”</p>

<p>Mika answer, as though it’s nothing.</p>

<p>“Am I related to it too?​”<br />
“Mm—?”<br />
“I mean, did I contribute you, to destroy it?”<br />
“Mm—mm,” Mika shook her head; “Not… contributed.”</p>

<p><em>Phew</em>, Lydia was fairly relieved to hear Mika’s words.</p>

<p>“I see. And for what reason did Mika bring the world doom?”<br />
“Er, that was, a wish, of humanity…”<br />
“The wish of, humanity?”</p>

<p>Said Yuuyami, appears to be unconvinced.</p>

<p>“Ah—, um—, that is… Aki-chan, explain… hereupon, I think.”<br />
“Hmm. What is Aki-chan?”</p>

<p>Casually asked Lydia.</p>

<p>“Cheating is… no good. Think it over… yourself.”<br />
“Tsk, even though I thought I’d get the answer.”</p>

<p>Lydia spread her arms.<br />
Timing wasn’t bad, the question was in natural flow; so, Lydia thought, if I would be lucky, Mika will speak just like that.<br />
Well, albeit it is not particularly work, it doesn’t matter. I asked for the sake of mere  trial.</p>

<p>“Mika, has to speak… something other than just, about Aki-chan.”<br />
“Uh-huh. What is it?”</p>

<p>Asked Lydia; Mika briskly, with a small steps, drew near Lydia and, just like that, embraced her.</p>

<p>“I love you… onee-chan.”<br />
“Tha, thank you.”</p>

<p>Lydia a little hesitated, whether stroke Mika’s head or not.<br />
Mika is taller and has a larger breasts. The impression Mika gave off more of onee-chan.</p>

<p>“Hey—, stop. Stop it—”</p>

<p>Yuuyami broke in between the two, and divide Lydia of Mika.</p>

<p>“Mika-san.”<br />
“Mm?”<br />
“In what sense do you have a love for Lydia?”<br />
“Eh? Mika… loves onee-chan, as onee-chan. It’s okay… I won’t, snatch her from bed.”<br />
“I see. I’m relieved. Pray continue.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami took a one step backward.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami, you rather jealous, aren’t you?”<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>At Lydia remark, Yuuyami snapped her eyes open.<br />
Apparently, Yuuyami appears to be unaware.</p>

<p>“You pulled me apart at tremendous velocity even at that time with Apricot.”<br />
“W, was that so?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami grew blurry.<br />
For Yuuyami do not bear the ability to lie, she cannot say “There was no such phenomenon.”<br />
So you bound to remember it, for there’s an action log, guessed Lydia.</p>

<p>“But I’m not particularly condemn you, you know? Instead, I’m rather pleased.”</p>

<p><em>Ehehe</em>, tittered Lydia.</p>

<p>“Yes. I pulled you apart at the great speed.”</p>

<p>Proudly stated Yuuyami.<br />
How mercantile–, thought Lydia.<br />
Supposing Yuuyami was born as a human, with emotions from the very beginning, most likely she would have grown up having this kind of personality, no mistaking it.<br />
Well, there is no such thing, thus no point to use imagination.<br />
I like the indifferent Yuuyami as well as the bright one, thought Lydia.<br />
Henceforth Yuuyami will be wield by emotions, will be saying things that she doesn’t properly understand, and her personality will slightly alter.<br />
However, Lydia loves Yuuyami so much that such matter appear to be trivial.</p>

<p>“…Love birds…”</p>

<p>Said Mika, in whisper.<br />
Lydia and Yuuyami pretended not to hear it.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mika, will you stay tonight?”</p>

<p>Asked Lydia, in order to change the subject.</p>

<p>“Mm—mm,” Mika shook her head: “Mika, going home.”<br />
“I see. I still have a lot to talk about so come again.”<br />
“Mm—mm.”</p>

<p>Mika shook her head once more.</p>

<p>“Mika, won’t be coming, any more. Therefore.. it’s, a sayonara, as well…”<br />
“Why won’t you come?”<br />
“Since, before long, Mika, will go… far away… Mika already prepared.”<br />
“Far away? If I go by motorcycle, can I go to play around?”<br />
“Impossible.”</p>

<p>Mika set afloat, just a little, but lonely smile.</p>

<p>“Eh—? Where are you going?”<br />
“Secret.”<br />
“Even though it was such long-awaited encounter…”<br />
“It’ll be okay. Onee-chan… has Yuuyami.., chibi-nee-chan, and Hina, too…”<br />
“That’s right, and you, Mika, will have but Mika?”<br />
“Fufu… Makes me happy… But, <em>bye-bye</em>…”</p>

<p>Mika fluttered her wings and ascent, such appeared rather amorous.</p>

<p>“Is that truly a <em>bye-bye</em>?”<br />
“Uh-huh. I love you, onee-chan… And, Yuuyami.”<br />
“Me subsequently?”<br />
“It’s not, the case. Do your best, together, from now on, okay?”<br />
“Although I don’t actually understand, but alright. Take care.”</p>

<p>Farewells are lonely, however I cannot force her to detain.<br />
For Mika has a life of Mika.<br />
Just like Lydia has a life of Lydia.</p>

<p>“Give my regards, to Noah.”<br />
“You know Noah?”<br />
“Uh-huh. The best, bike.”</p>

<p>Mika smiled happily, recollected something as though.<br />
Whereafter,</p>

<p>“So, long.”</p>

<p>Mika waved her hand,<br />
fluttered her wings,<br />
and vanished, just like that.<br />
It was as though she didn’t exist in the first place.</p>

<p>“She is gone.”</p>

<p>Whispered Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. How did she vanish?”<br />
“I don’t know. However, over there are traces of a little distorted space.”<br />
“Perhaps she didn’t disappear, perhaps she break through to the different airspace-?”<br />
“Such might be, I’m not fully understand.”<br />
“Well, let’s drink <em>café au lait</em>​ and continue designing our child?”<br />
“Yes. Shall we.”</p>

<p>The matters, that we need to do, have piled up like a mountain.<br />
The matters, that we wish to do, are so numerous as there are stars.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>The monitor-room located but slightly out of phase with Lydia’s library.<br />
Upon Mika return to that monitor-room</p>

<p>“Thou art positive in this?”</p>

<p>The iris flower was waving there.</p>

<p>“What?”<br />
“We yet can turn back, right? Thou mayst choose, too, the path to live together with Lydia and others.”<br />
“…Mika, will go with Aki-chan…”<br />
“Ourself made mere final acknowledgment.”<br />
“Mika, is not… so interested, in this planet.”</p>

<p>With that said, Mika fold her wings, and placed herself upon the floor.<br />
Albeit there is no illumination in the room, the light emitted by monitors is dazzling.</p>

<p>“Yea.”</p>

<p>Iris narrowed its stem.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>With a nod, Mika pointed her gaze at the monitor.<br />
The monitor show Lydia, the monitor show Rapha, the monitor show Hinagiku, as well as various distinct places in the world.<br />
Soon, she shall part with this room likewise.</p>

<p>“Epilogue for ourself.”</p>

<p>Quoth Iris, Mika looked towards Iris.</p>

<p>“Prologue for Lydia and Yuuyami.”<br />
“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>Said Mika, listening.</p>

<p>“Such is nigh to the end. Such is the end, and the beginning. Ourself, too, feels a little lonely.”<br />
“But… this is, the way it is, right?”<br />
“Yea. Well, now, we hast to remodel Mika’s body a little further. So in order to depart with ourself.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Would it, hurt?”<br />
“Have it ever hurt?”</p>

<p>Iris inclined the flower to the side.</p>

<p>“Not. It was, just the line, I always, wanted to say.”<br />
“Understood.”</p>

<p>Iris let out a short giggle as though, so it seemed to Mika.</p>
