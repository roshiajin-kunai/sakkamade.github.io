    <p class="first-paragraph">“Youch–!”</p>

<p>Lydia pressed upon her groin, curling herself up on a place.<br />
Lydia is a petite girl, who appeared to be around thirteen of age, has a small breasts. Her hair is bright, shiny blond. It is a little curly, of length nigh a chest. Her skin is fair and smooth. It reminiscent me a beauteous snowscape.<br />
We are inside a self-defence <em>dojo</em><sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which built by the side of underground library.<br />
Three months had passed since Lydia and Yuuyami became Creators. This self-defence <em>dojo</em> was constructed by ​​Lydia’s suggestion, as the Creator leastwise she should be able to protect herself.<br />
Within the <em>dojo</em> there are four-and-twenty <em>tatami</em> mats<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and a board-covered area of an equal extent. Having a tall ceiling, the room resulted spacious. Wooden swords and canes in various sizes were installed upon a corners of board-covered area.</p>

<p>“Ah-! Lydia, your precious​ room!”</p>

<p>Yuuyami rushed across to Lydia.<br />
Whereafter she undertook striping a scarlet <em>hokama</em><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> off Lydia.</p>

<p>“May I lick it? I’d better lick it, right? I fancy to lick it.”<br />
“Hey, wait, Yuuyami, you can’t! I’m  practising yet!”</p>

<p>Lydia suppressed the head of Yuuyami.<br />
Both Lydia and Yuuyami wore scarlet <em>hokama</em> over a white <em>dogi</em>.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup><br />
Apropos, Yuuyami had recently embedded a taste sensor. And from that time forward she grew enthusiast  licking a various objects. She loving to taste Lydia’s body in particular, and she will lick it upon every opportunity.<br />
Yuuyami has an appearance of a Japanese lady of about eighteen of age, her hair is black and long. Forelock cut straight. Her bosom is larger than Lydia’s, however generally modest.<br />
Her visage is harmonious at a level which without a hindrance​ might be described as the God has represented all the beauty upon. Surely there is no life-form under this universe that is more lovely than you, Yuuyami—was convinced Lydia.</p>

<p>“Oi, you, over there, Yuuyami.”</p>

<p>A youth in a white <em>dogi</em> and black <em>hokama</em> seized Yuuyami’s nape and hauled her away.<br />
This youth named a Konohana Kizuna. One and twenty years of age. He is a master of <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em>, which considered  strongest a martial art prior the world’s collapse.<br />
He has a cool villainous features, the hair is black and doesn’t cover his eyes. He is not very tall, however at a glance it is plain that he is muscular and well-trained.</p>

<p>“Oh-, dragging me with one hand, a man, in sooth.”</p>

<p>Said Yuuyami, admiringly.</p>

<p>“No normal man would do it. You’re much heavier that one can guess from your appearance, you know?”<br />
“Well, I shall admit the parts composing myself are slightly heavier than the parts composing humans. However, a lighter and farther a durable material under developing at present. The target weight is fifty kilograms.”</p>

<p>Stated Yuuyami, wearing a composed expression, whereas being hauled.</p>

<p>“…Is she <em>hentai</em>?”</p>

<p>Said, rising before Lydia, lady. She likewise wear white <em>dogi</em> and scarlet <em>hokama</em>.<br />
She is a lady whose name is Mari Kuga. One and twenty years of age. A granddaughter of the founder of <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em>, and a master as Kizuna.<br />
Her hair is black and longish, slender of constitution. Her breasts, too, were hardly to be found. They may be placed upon  even  more unassuming level than of Lydia, but for her training, however, she had such figure.<br />
Single dropped petal in comparison to Yuuyami and Lydia, however Mari also has her own tidy countenance. Nevertheless, appear somewhat a villainess.<br />
Incidentally, it was Mari to kick Lydia in the groin.<br />
For I was able to perform something like <em>ukemi</em><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> to a certain extent, now I was taught the basis of crotch-kicking as a form of self-defence.<br />
In <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em>, such is necessary to incur a technique once, so to cognise​ whatever technique it is.<br />
As such, an impact befall a groin of Lydia.</p>

<p>“Not a <em>hentai</em>, rather, recently I have impression​ as though my patterns of thought​s grew slightly soft and fluffy.”<br />
“Soft and fluffy?”<br />
“Right. Soft and fluffy.”</p>

<p>Rising up, Lydia secured her <em>hokama</em>.</p>

<p>“Hmm. Well, okay.”</p>

<p>Mari lightly shrugged her shoulders.<br />
Apropos, neither Kizuna nor Mari are actual human beings. The period of their reside was beyond three hundred a years ago.<br />
This <em>dojo</em> uses a holo-system, thus Kizuna and Mari are but projected stereoscopic images. Provided that it is an advanced stereoscopy they can be touched.<br />
Furthermore, for their bodies and brains are conscientiously re-emerged against old medical data, their personalities and memories are perfect. Hence, neither Kizuna nor Mari are many different from the authentic articles. They merely lacking a life and consciousness.</p>

<p>“By the way, Mari-sensei,” says Lydia; “is it truth that you two travelled back and forth between parallel realities… briefly, parallel worlds?”<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Whereas I investigated strongest a martial art, <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em>, there was such an account. Of course, no one believed it at that period, thence it was treated  an idle gossip.<br />
Lydia wanted to question it one day, however she could not afford a room to think of anything else during the trainings, and afterwards she has been so exhausted that kept forgetting.</p>

<p>“If you talking of the Otherworld, then yes. We defeated the demon king in the Otherworld at the age of thirteen, and were summoned again at the age of seventeen, this time for teaching a perishing demon of combat.”<br />
“If you were summoned, then there were such a technology, in that parallel reality— Otherworld, right?”<br />
“Technology you say, that was magic.”<br />
“Magic!?”</p>

<p>Lydia snapped her eyes open, in surprise.<br />
There is no magic under this world. Nigh the World War IV, it appears that there were people of special ability named a Six Sense. However, past the war days, Six Sense gradually grew obsolete.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll talk about magic and Otherworld one of these days, now is a training.”<br />
“Yes–. The objective is to beat Ohan!”</p>

<p>Lydia clenched her fist and raised it up high.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>One year and six months have passed thenceforth.<br />
Lydia and Yuuyami kept practice upon either rainy and windy days without an intermission.<br />
Of course, we also steadily advanced the projects we had. However, the state of the  world exploration can be called suspended.<br />
As for present, we plan to resume the exploration upon acquiring a self-defence ability.</p>

<p>“Well, now you have passed the <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em> fourth <em>dan</em> test.”</p>

<p>Stated Kizuna, appearing deeply emotional.<br />
In the <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em>, the fourth <em>dan</em> positioned as a <em>teacher</em>.<br />
Incidentally, at fifth <em>dan</em> or higher one would reach a <em>master</em>.<br />
Both Kizuna and Mari are of the highest tenth <em>dan</em>. Within its history there are but the founder, Kizuna, Mari, and a few others having it.<br />
Amidst them, Kizuna and Mari hold a titles of strongest under a bonnet of this world. According to one theory, it was said that the two of them comparable to military force of a small country.</p>

<p>“Fourth <em>dan</em> in such a short period, reminds me Lyulyu.”</p>

<p>Said Mari, gazing into a distance.<br />
Lyulyu is the first apprentice of Kizuna and Mari, the demon princess. Lydia passim listened to their Otherworld’s heroic saga, she knows, thus, of Lyulyu along with their other friends.<br />
One day, when I accomplish the world exploration, I should depart upon adventure in to the parallel reality, planned Lydia.</p>

<p>“Well, for I am outstanding,” Yuuyami remarked with all her heart; “I have nothing to hide, after all I am the latest, the uttermost Autodoll.”<br />
“Have you forgotten of Shii-chan?”</p>

<p>Upon Lydia meddle in:</p>

<p>“…<em>Was</em> the latest and uttermost Autodoll in a previous generation.”</p>

<p>Rephrased Yuuyami.<br />
She wanted to put the <em>latest and uttermost</em> at any cost, judged Lydia.</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s about a time for you to be able to fight that fellow Ohan.”<br />
“In fact, who can even compare to Lydiyami under this perished… no, under this Renewed World?”</p>

<p>Suggested Kizuna. Mari bent her neck.</p>

<p>“No one, I presume.”</p>

<p>Said Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“But, what if we expand the scope of exploration to universe and parallel realities in the future?”<br />
“Such is, well, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Assumed Lydia. Yuuyami nodded.<br />
Well, proceed in to the space, parallel realities, such is hitherto a business of a distant future.</p>

<p>“If so, let’s keep training.”<br />
“That’s great. The two of you can surely reach a tenth <em>dan</em>.”</p>

<p>Lydia and Yuuyami grew a warm smiles upon receiving endorsement of the masters.</p>

<p>“Then, let’s call Rapha and Ohan at once!”<br />
“Indeed. Such was our original goal.”</p>

<p>To beat Ohan. This is Lydia’s objective.<br />
If she becomes stronger than Ohan, she may be considered a nigh perfect in self-defence.<br />
Initially, according to the calculations of Yuuyami, it was necessary to have seventh <em>dan</em>-level to gain a victory over Ohan. However, with present body-modifications of Ohan, a victory appears to be probable having around a fourth <em>dan</em> of strength.</p>

<p>“With that said, let us flirt in commemoration, if you gain a victory over Ohan.”</p>

<p>Wearing a solemn expression, Yuuyami propose​d something that I cannot quite understand.</p>

<p>“Eh? We doing it every day, are we not?”</p>

<p>Lydia and Yuuyami kept living a lovey-dovey life ever since they recognised their love for each other. There infrequent quarrels every now and again, generally,  however, upon a kiss they are turning back normal.</p>

<p>“Forget a projects and training, let us flirt for twenty-and-four hours.”<br />
“…I wonder if I am yet strong enough–…”</p>

<p>I have to reproduce nutrition drinks, thought Lydia.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Rapha and Ohan arrived to <em>dojo</em> in hardly an hour.<br />
Rapha has an invariant hair, peach of colour, and Gothic Lolita outfit as before. She appeared to be a little girl of around eleven years of age, chest the precipitous cliff. Her eyes are round and cute.<br />
And, withal that.<br />
Ohan have passed into an adult onee-san in the middle of her twenties.  Rapha created this novel body  by the occasion of Rapha and Ohan start dating.<br />
Ohan has a satsuma orange hair tint, of equal to Yuuyami’s length. She had, however, her hair braided in one point upon the right side.<br />
Her skin of regular colour. Not so white as Lydia’s. She dressed in azure military uniform, however her skirt was short.<br />
Bosom is bigger than of Yuuyami, but is not too big and appeared just right. Her figure, too, was neat. Lydia instantly grasped, this was the only place Rapha was exceptionally fixated upon.<br />
Her features gave an impression of a superior official setting, a little severe. Pretty, but  somewhat eerie.<br />
And, withal that,</p>

<p>“Why are you, Ohan, having a whip in your hand?”</p>

<p>Ohan hold a horse-riding whip in her right hand. Lydia asked whereas viewing it.</p>

<p>“This is Rapha’s hobby.”</p>

<p>Ohan lightly revised a manner of speech upon occasion of dating Rapha. Was what she said, however she merely stopped using honorifics.</p>

<p>“Wait, Ohan!?” cried Rapha, visibly agitated. “Can you stop making such a misleading remarks!?”<br />
“He—. Rapha likes this kind of play–. She’s a daughter of Hinagiku after all–.”</p>

<p>Said Lydia with a giggle.</p>

<p>“Wah, no! Th, th, th, that’s not what, she meeeant!?”<br />
“Rapha-san, you stutter.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami had a composed, apathetic bearing.</p>

<p>“But you use it upon <em>ecchi</em>-time, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Threw a question Lydia, whilst peering up at Ohan. Ohan is taller than Yuuyami. Of course, she is tiny​ in comparison to former military body, but notwithstanding that she is yet the tallest of all an intelligent life-forms over here.</p>

<p>“Because Rapha had set matters regarding sexual activity a top secret, I can not reveal the content of the play.”<br />
“Eh—? In other words–”<br />
“Playing something that should be left unsaid.”</p>

<p>Whereas grinning, Lydia passed a look at Yuuyami: Yuuyami raised her index finger, pondering over​— having suspicion.</p>

<p>“Wah, no! No! Wah, it’s different!” <em>whosh, whosh,</em>  waved her hands Rapha. “I just reproduced it for I thought it would look good on Ohan!”<br />
“Mm—?” Lydia linked her hands behind her spine, and leaned forth, peering at Rapha. “Say-, why are you so flustered-?”<br />
“Th, th, this is too much, waaa!!”</p>

<p>Rapha cling on to Ohan.</p>

<p>“Onee-sama is so mean, waaa!”</p>

<p>Rapha tend to call Lydia onee-_sama_. Such is also from about  a time when they started dating.</p>

<p>“There, there.”</p>

<p>Ohan lightly lifted Rapha up, and shook a body to cuddle her.</p>

<p>“Rapha’s spoiledness accelerating! Yuuyami!”<br />
“Yes!”</p>

<p>Upon Lydia cast a gaze at Yuuyami, Yuuyami immediately unfold her arms.<br />
And now, Lydia also embraced Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Rapha-san and Ohan are such a love birds, are they not? Flirting in a broad daylight.”<br />
“That’s right-. I wish they were a little more restrained.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami gently brushed Lydia’s head. Lydia rubbed her cheeks within  Yuuyami’s bosom.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“So when will they start duelling?”</p>

<p>Asked Kizuna, leaning against a wall of <em>dojo</em>.</p>

<p>“Who knows. But they’ve just started chatter.”</p>

<p>Standing in a similar manner upon the left of Kizuna, Mari let out a breath.</p>

<p>“You know, I’m pretty out of place with all these women around, right?”<br />
“Well, this is a lily garden, it can’t be helped, I think.”<br />
“I guess. But I feel so alienated, huh–.”<br />
“…I’m here, you know?”<br />
“…Yeah.”<br />
“Don’t worry, I’ll always be together with you, Kizuna.”</p>

<p>Mari lifts her right fist up to the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Aha. Maybe until I die.”</p>

<p>Kizuna clenched his left fist, and lightly tapped Mari’s.</p>

<p>“Is it a friendship? Or affection, <em>desu?</em> Are you married, <em>desu?</em> ”<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Questioned Shii, upon tottering up to the pair.<br />
Shii, the daughter of Lydia and Yuuyami, had just come to the <em>dojo</em>, but for the flock of love birds  were flirting about, she passed through them.<br />
Shii has a tawny shortcut and boyish features.<br />
Shii wears a white <em>dogi</em> and a scarlet <em>hokama</em>, inasmuch as she also tentatively learning the <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em>. However, is not so ardent for training as Lydiyami.<br />
Incidentally, Shii as yet unconscious at this period.</p>

<p>“Neither–.”<br />
“If I must answer, antagonism.”</p>

<p>Shrugged his shoulders Kizuna. Mari replied.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand… <em>desu</em>.”<br />
“It’s okay, I don’t understand it too.”<br />
“Yeah. We aren’t understand it well.”</p>

<p>Albeit they say to be ignorant, they appear enjoying themselves. As though sharing a momentous secret, such an ambience.</p>

<p>“Hmm. Intelligent life complicated, <em>desu</em>.”</p>

<p>Shii slightly shook a head.</p>

<p>“Let us get back to the point,” says Kizuna; “how long are they intend to keep it up?”<br />
“Really,” agrees Mari. “Although I think we are pretty mentally strong.”<br />
“You have got steel nerves, <em>desu</em>.”<br />
“Even <em>we</em> now about to get a slight heartburn, right?”<br />
“Uh-huh. Too sweet. This place is too sweet.”<br />
“This is what happens when two sugary couples get together. Or rather, what if I say that here is another pair of such a love birds, <em>desu?</em> ”<br />
“…Give me a break.”<br />
“…I miss the world of violence.”</p>

<p>Kizuna and Mari dropped their shoulders.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>It was a twenty minutes after Rapha and Ohan arrival that Lydia and Ohan bowed, facing each other.<br />
Having a whip in a right hand, Ohan snapped it once in the air.<br />
Lydia assumed a stance reflecting on her right.</p>

<p>“Ohan holds a weapon,” says Shii. “It is disadvantageous of mama-Lydi, isn’t it?”<br />
“It is vice versa,” Kizuna assured: “this restrains Ohan’s attack technique.”<br />
“Yeah,” Mari nods. “In a natural flow of conversation, Lydia suggested her own advantageous rule. Natural little devil.”</p>

<p>At present, Ohan has an incorporated ethics subroutine, she cannot, thus, provide Lydia a severe damage.<br />
Lydia requested for consent to shut down her ethics subroutine, however didn’t gain Rapha’s acceptance.<br />
Thereupon, Lydia offered the method to determine a winner which should admit even her ethics subroutine.</p>

<p>“In other words, mama-Lydi has followed the teachings of <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em> and lured her opponent at a disadvantage, <em>desu?</em> ”<br />
“That’s how it is. But, as Mari-chan said, there’s no calculations, it’s probably natural. Well, I guess this fellow Lydia thought, ‘I am cute and loved by everyone, I can obtain a consent for anything I say.’”<br />
“Ah—. Yeah. It’s hard to refuse when Lydia asks, peering up at you with those eyes of hers,” stated Mari. “Hello and welcome, I am Mari with a latest commentary. According to the rule Lydia has suggested: If Ohan hit Lydia’s butt with a whip—Ohan wins. And now to our play-by-play man, Kizuna-san?”<br />
“Ah–. Er, this is Kizuna-san from the scene. Err, Ohan is not just limited  to attack technique, but also to the spot of attack. Furthermore, having a high defence power,  the butt is not prone to easily bear a critical damage. She, too, prepared to be hit upon that place; Mary?”<br />
“Yes,” Mari nodded. “A great natural little devil, aren’t she–. But this is not a point, Ohan in a really disadvantageous situation.”<br />
“And yet, only Mari-chan and myself realise​d that Ohan at disadvantage, huh–.”<br />
“Because,” says Shii, “usually it is better to have a weapon. Ohan-onee-san is a pretty good combatant.”<br />
“Well, and back to Kizuna-san form the scene. As for Lydia, she can achieve a victory by inflicting  a damage upon Ohan which  would be enough to take  down an ordinary human,” says Kizuna. “At first sight, such appears fairly difficult, but, taking into account present Lydia, her single blow will be sufficient.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, Ohan will not break from this. The damage which takes a human down is trivial from Ohan’s point.<br />
Albeit her body  weaker than before,  the current Ohan, as Shii said, also hold an  extremely high fighting and defence abilities.</p>

<p>“Well, then!” Yuuyami, who  draw upon herself a role of arbitrator, elevates her right hand. “The bout between Lydia and Ohan, will begin, now!”</p>

<p>Subsequently swung her right hand down.<br />
At the same time, Ohan took an action. In one pace, she emerged behind Lydia, snapping her whip crossways.<br />
Whereas turning, Lydia reached for Ohan’s hand which was clasping a whip, thus diverting the attack downward.<br />
Ohan lost her stance, and whip hit a <em>tatami</em> mat.</p>

<p>”!?”</p>

<p>Ohan  leaped backwards, in surprise.<br />
Ohan’s power expected to exceed Lydia’s plainly.</p>

<p>“Ohan, if you won’t get more serious, I’ll evade everything, you know?”</p>

<p>Said Lydia with a placid​ expression.</p>

<p>“Well, then, at the limit of ethics subroutine.”</p>

<p>Ohan takes another stride forth to get round Lydia.<br />
However, Lydia foresaw Ohan’s move. For, according to the rules, Ohan cannot  attack her unless behind.<br />
Thus, upon an instant of Ohan’s action, Lydia have yet shifted her disposition, and went straight for the upper kick.<br />
Being unable to attack the front of Lydia, Ohan suppressed a whip and turned guard against Lydia’s kick.<br />
For Lydia’s height, even her upper kick could not reach Ohan’s shoulder.<br />
Ohan bent her arm to let a forearm guard the kick,</p>

<p><em>“Kuga Ha Shinryu: Invasion!”</em></p>

<p>With her arm at guard, Ohan’s body arched in a curve, and just like that flew abreast, piercing the wall of the <em>dojo</em>, whereafter rolled over the ground outside.</p>

<p>“Ooooooh, Ohan!!”</p>

<p>Upon shriek ish cry, Rapha  rushed towards Ohan.<br />
However in prior of Rapha’s arrival, Ohan arose up and proceed to stroll as if nothing have happened, and, lifting Rapha who was closing up, stepped in to the <em>dojo</em>.</p>

<p>“I have calculated the damage, <em>desu</em>. Mama-Lydi wins.”</p>

<p>Indifferently said Shii.</p>

<p>“The current kick was powerful enough to bring an ordinary human down.”</p>

<p>Ohan halted before Lydia, and said so, plainly.</p>

<p>“Ohan, are you okay!? Nothing is broke!?”<br />
“No problem. My body is the ultimate body created by Rapha. It will not break from this kind of damage.”<br />
“Haa–,” Yuuyami shoved in between Lydia and Ohan. “How may you name your body ultimate disregarding me?”<br />
“If you question me, I have a better performance, <em>desu</em>.”</p>

<p>Shii remarked, in whisper.</p>

<p>“My body is magnificent. And not at all inferior to Shii-chan.”—Ohan perfectly heard Shii-chan’s words—“My quantum brain is elaborate, too, and it will not take long before I become conscious.”<br />
“Hum. However I was the first to obtain consciousness. Indeed, I am a consciousness <em>senpai</em>. You may address me Yuuyami-senpai, I presume?”</p>

<p>Proudly stated Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“O—i. You should bow after you done.”</p>

<p>Said Kizuna. Ohan placed Rapha down, and bowed.<br />
Lydia also bowed, at the same time.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Ohan.”</p>

<p>Said Lydia, as a smile played over her face.</p>

<p>“Not at all. I am glad to be of any help.”</p>

<p>Ohan smiles softly.</p>

<p>“Well, then, dismissed!” demanded Yuuyami.<br />
“Eh—?” Rapha cried in amazement. “We are no longer needed!?”<br />
“No, it is not what I meant,” indifferently says Yuuyami. “For I have an important business with Lydia hereafter, we shall forgather again at a later date.”<br />
“Ah.., it’s but started…”</p>

<p>And now, I have to swiftly​ reproduce nutrition drinks, thought Lydia.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Lydia is always sleep upon the futon which laid over the library floor.<br />
And upon that very futon Lydia and Yuuyami were sitting now, facing each other.<br />
Upon the floor beside a futon, a pile of nutrition drinks was thereat. These nutrition drinks were not  articles reproduced by Lydia, but articles reproduced by Yuuyami. According to her, a deluxe​ twenty-four hours’ combat drink.<br />
Lydia have already taken one.<br />
In order for Lydia to drink a lot, Yuuyami adjusted a taste to be  refreshingly sweet and easy to drink.</p>

<p>“Somehow,” says Lydia: “because usually  we get to <em>ecchi</em> under the flow of the mood–, it’s a little stressing when we are about to do it now, while like this, opposite each other, right? And you, Yuuyami, in such a <em>seiza</em>.”<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup><br />
“In, indeed.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami darted her spine straight; her <em>seiza</em> is very beautiful. If there were a <em>seiza</em> championship, she  would definitely have been a champion.</p>

<p>“Then, let’s chat for awhile, until a suitable mood.”<br />
“Yes. All right. It’s a nice weather today, is it not?”<br />
“Good day for exploring. Can we go on exploration?”<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami distorted into extremely sad countenance.</p>

<p>“That was a jest.”<br />
“…Lydia, you are a bit mean lately, aren’t you?”<br />
“Is that so?”<br />
“So that is, certainly.”<br />
“Do you hate it?”<br />
“No. Rather, I might like you being mean. May you also call me a Masoyami-san?”</p>

<p>Stated composed Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Then, see you again, Masoyami-san.”<br />
“…<em>Kablooey!</em> Masoyami-san has passed away–. I am Yuuyami. I would not want to wait.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami has an extraordinary greedy personality. She wasn’t like this in the past, but ever since she started to deal with a lots of emotions, she grew more and more humane.<br />
How should I put it, her personality was turning more and more rubbishy— soft and fluffy.<br />
Lydia loved the cool Yuuyami of the past, however she also loves a soft and fluffy Yuuyami of today.</p>

<p>“But, this doesn’t make a mood any better.”<br />
“Indeed. We are in trouble.”</p>

<p><em>Mn—</em>, tilted her head Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“A little more chatter then.”</p>

<p>Upon saying, Lydia threw herself down, placing her  head upon Yuuyami’s  thighs. A so-called lap pillow position.<br />
Yuuyami gently smoothed down Lydia’s head.</p>

<p>“Lydia, on the other side, has become stronger, right,” says Yuuyami, quietly. “Albeit you, Lydia, a new human breed, originally was highly capable, you was able to win Ohan at present.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Well, rules were in my favour today. In addition, if Ohan didn’t have an ethics subroutine, if it was weapon-Ohan, I would probably lose then.”<br />
“But there is no longer a weapon-Ohan.”<br />
“Right. That glittering silver body was cool, too, however I like a current Ohan better–.”<br />
“The appearance?”<br />
“Mm–mm. I think, current Ohan won’t slay a snake any more.”<br />
“Ah,” Yuuyami nods; “you, Lydia, have unceasingly been anxious over it.”<br />
“Uh-huh. That’s why, I wished to get stronger, you know.”<br />
“How related?”<br />
“Ohan of that time murdered a snake to protect me. If I were stronger back then, if I weren’t surprised by the snakes’ warning, and didn’t topple over, Ohan wouldn’t have crushed a snake, I think. Or else, upon an attempt to crush it, I could save it. “<br />
“However, it was not your fault, Lydia…”<br />
“But, Yuuyami, I had perfectly forgotten that Ohan was a weapon, you know? And I brought her on exploration quite unconsciously.”</p>

<p>Lydia laughed, a little sadly.<br />
Yuuyami stroked Lydia’s head again. Much softer than before.</p>

<p>“For that reason you set the goal to gain a victory over Ohan?”<br />
“Yes. I thought if I was stronger than Ohan, such won’t happen again; but I would’ve never imagined that Rapha and Ohan will adhere together and Ohan will change a body.”<br />
“I expected someday it bound to result such, aren’t I?”<br />
“Right–. Only Yuuyami perceived Rapha and Ohan’s mutual feelings—.”<br />
“Pray praise me.”<br />
“It’s amazing, Yuuyami, you are so acute as a brilliant detective.”</p>

<p>Said Lydia. Yuuyami smiled, delightedly.</p>

<p>“Hence, there’s something I have to turn your acuteness in a good use.”<br />
“Yes?”<br />
“Does Rapha and Ohan actually play with that whip–?”<br />
“Of course, certainly. Most likely Rapha-san says, ‘Ohan, will you punish me, I was such a bad girl today, you know?’”<br />
“And, then, Ohan returns like this: ‘Ha–, Rapha, you are really a helpless girl–, come here.’ ‘Kya—!’”</p>

<p>Placing a hands upon her cheeks, Lydia  wriggled her body.</p>

<p>“‘Kya—!’”</p>

<p>Yuuyami’s cheeks dyed, and her body jolted.<br />
Then, for a next few moments, the pair squealed, <em>Kya, kya,</em> while imagining Rapha and Ohan.</p>

<p>“Now, Yuuyami, there is another case for your acuteness.”</p>

<p>Whereas saying, Lydia raised up, and seated herself upon Yuuyami’s lap. Facing Yuuyami, of course.</p>

<p>“You became a little aroused imagining Rapha-san and Ohan’s play?”<br />
“It’s different! Ah, no, it’s not different, but it’s not…”<br />
“I understand. You don’t have to say any more.”<br />
“I like chattering–, so if you won’t stop me, I would talk for ever, you know?”</p>

<p>Said Lydia. Yuuyami smiled, gently.<br />
Whereafter, Yuuyami rested her lips upon Lydia’s.<br />
Tender kisses gradually then grew ardent.<br />
Ah–, taste of nutrition drink—, thought Yuuyami, having embedded a taste sensor.<br />
That was a correct choice of sugary-flavoured nutrition drinks–, so she also deemed.</p>
