    <p>From Rapha’s perspective, Mika was an incomprehensible creature.<br />
Mika, the Third Tenmoku, creation of Angel Project, held far more intelligence than Rapha, and greatly excelled archaic humans in physical abilities.<br />
Researchers were overjoyed with it; only at the beginning however.<br />
Before long, they likewise recognised Mika as failure.<br />
Albeit Rapha was introduced to Mika as her younger sister, I didn’t feel like we would be getting along at all.<br />
Mika has never smiled nor altered her facial expression. Rapha couldn’t even paltry grasp the path of her thoughts.<br />
Hence, we instantly grew alienated. Since Rapha had Lucy however, that meant few to me.<br />
Thereafter, a few weeks later, I was scared to hear, Mika strangled a researcher. Perhaps, she would have done that to me as well.<br />
This estrangement rather positive, I concluded. I also drew conclusion that the fact Lucy hadn’t hitherto met Mika being positive likewise.<br />
Whereas existence of Angel Project itself was concealed, Mika could not be judged officially.<br />
Due to prohibition for humankind​ to manufacture humans.<br />
But withal, people of desire to cross beyond such taboos had break forth into this world. Akin the group that gathered for Angel Project, whilst secretly advancing it.<br />
Mika was isolated, yet, strangely enough, no one offered to dispose of her. Under  simple pretext: assuming they somehow manage her behaviour, Mika would be specimen of perfect success.<br />
In other words, even a failure at present could become corrected step by step, believed  researchers.</p>

<p>“I can educate Mika.”</p>

<p>Upon completion of development of LM series type Ⅱ, Lucy stated so.</p>

<p>“Wah, onee-chama, this a great peril. She strangled one; Mika equal to fierce animal.”</p>

<p>Immediately objected Rapha.</p>

<p>“It’s different. Probably no one taught her, right? Level of Mika’s abilities so high that everyone mistakenly believed she knew everything, but at times one should teach her, for her insight.”<br />
“Even so, such a thing as strangle one’s neck.”<br />
“Rapha was not so amazing, at first. You was so riotous.”</p>

<p>Said with a giggle Lucy.</p>

<p>“W, wah, I wasn’t riotous​!”<br />
“Shouted, kicked, screamed, begging me to do this, begging me to do  that, haven’t you?”<br />
“I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>Prim Rapha turned the other way.</p>

<p>“Well, since I believe I can, I’ll suggest it to director.”<br />
“Wah, onee-chama being overconfident.”</p>

<p>Let out a short sigh Rapha.<br />
Shortly afterwards, director received Lucy’s proposal.<br />
Lucy meet Mika, and assessed to take care of her. <br />
Whereupon Mika appeared to take a liking of Lucy, what didn’t pleased Rapha.<br />
Subsequently, during next year, Rapha also met Mika upon several occasions. Mika seemed to slightly ameliorate; as usual however, she didn’t tend to get on good terms.<br />
When ultimately, one day, Mika disappeared.</p>

<p>“Rapha, hurry up, prepare the pods for artificial hibernation!”</p>

<p>Asked Lucy in panic.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama…?”</p>

<p>Upon such sudden request, Rapha tilted her head a little.</p>

<p>“Listen calmly. No questions. From now, we will be under suspended animation. Alright?”<br />
“Yes, okay.”<br />
“When I wake up, I must forget everything altogether, so, please, made me blank, okay?”<br />
“Eh?”<br />
“I decided to start over, out of nought. When I’lI wake up, I think there will be nothing in this world. Well, that’s up to Mika.”<br />
“Nothing will be there, how?”<br />
“No questions. That’s fate of humankind, the conclusion, inevitable. Accordingly, I have to forget, to begin again, and to create the world. Will you assist me?”<br />
“I’ll help you with anything.”</p>

<p>Without a proper insight, Rapha nodded.<br />
Lucy, from the beginning until end, was speaking impatiently, however Rapha was concerned only over sole aspect.<br />
Lucy were continuously smiling. Albeit only a little, but smiling.<br />
Even so, Rapha herself, deemed only after the collapse.<br />
Does onee-chama, actually, involved into this too?</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>From Mika’s perspective, the world was grey.<br />
Mika do not feel anything.<br />
By words of researchers, Mika did all sorts of things.<br />
They are delighted. But, Mika couldn’t understand why was they so pleased. The  grey  keeps on, as before.<br />
Mika didn’t feel anything towards Rapha who was introduced as Mika’s older sister. It’s all remains grey.<br />
One day, Mika strangled researcher. There was no deep meaning. Mika only wished to learn, outcome called the death.<br />
Eventually, following that death, Mika was separate​d by other researchers, Mika couldn’t understand a thing; everything remained grey.<br />
From that day, Mika was isolated.<br />
The arrived grey mornings were swallowing by grey nights. That was the flow of Mika dim time.<br />
And then, upon one of such a days, the intense Light come across Mika.<br />
The Light uttered:</p>

<p>“Mika, I’m your onee-chan - Lucifer; call me Lucy.”</p>

<p>Mika was dazzled by such an enormous radiance.<br />
From that day, the Light, named Lucy, took care of Mika.<br />
Lucy taught Mika of good and bad.<br />
Informed of enjoyable things. Of fashion. Taught Mika the fun of creation.<br />
Mika, gradually, began to behave humane as though.<br />
Over following circa one year, Mika decided to return Lucy a favour.</p>

<p>“Onee-chan… Mika will give you… the world. It’s actually for Mika… but, Mika, has… no interest.”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Lydia and others gathered in an underground parking.<br />
Lydia, Yuuyami, and Rapha, three of them.<br />
At the underground parking were being parked several cars, and jet-black motorcycle.</p>

<p>“Well then, thank you for everything, Rapha.”</p>

<p>Said Lydia, standing before the motorcycle.</p>

<p>“I am truly, appreciate your help.”</p>

<p>Seeing Yuuyami bow politely, Lydia mimicked the conduct.</p>

<p>“It’s okay, nothing special. More than that, if anything happens, please, contact me immediately, alright?”</p>

<p>Rapha elevates her left hand.<br />
Silver wearable was glittering on her wrist.</p>

<p>“Er, I can do it  directly, within radius of two hundred kilometres, right?”</p>

<p>Lydia, cast her gaze at her own left wrist. Wearable, that matched Rapha’s, was wrapped around.<br />
Incidentally, Yuuyami also equipped with such device.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right. If you go beyond two hundred kilometres, please leave it to repeater.”<br />
“I didn’t get a repeater, though.”<br />
“Please produce it yourself.”</p>

<p>Primming Rapha said so.</p>

<p>“Roger that.”<br />
“Well then, Onee-chama, take care.”<br />
“Uh-huh. I’ll come to play again.”</p>

<p>Lydia put her hand over the motorcycle handlebar, and lifted kickstand.<br />
Thereafter, turned motorcycle in the right direction.<br />
Upon the time Lydia mounted it:</p>

<p>“Ah, please wait. Onee-chama, going to search for Mika?”<br />
“Um. I’ll search, during the world exploration. I’d like to ask is she actually destroyed the world. Also, bring a light on my possible implication to that.”<br />
“You don’t even know if she’s alive, don’t you?”<br />
“I believe she is. Although at unknown whereabouts.”<br />
“Why do you think so?”<br />
“Why?”</p>

<p>Slightly tilted her head Lydia.</p>

<p>“I’m the one asking…”<br />
“I don’t understand it well. I just have such feeling.”<br />
“I, see. Onee-chama’s nature to decide upon, even at the meagre basis, huh.”<br />
“Is it?”<br />
“So it is,” Yuuyami being the one to answer.<br />
“Well, it’s okay, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Giggled Lydia.</p>

<p>“Wah, basis are important. Right, Yuuyami?”<br />
“I believe so.”</p>

<p>Upon Rapha casting a look at Yuuyami; Yuuyami gave a reply whereas revealing a mild nod.</p>

<p>“When did you become such close friends, you two?”<br />
“Wah, we aren’t particularly close. Besides, we had no discord from the beginning.”<br />
“In sooth. Hopefully we can become friends, someday.”<br />
“We’ll see.”</p>

<p>Lightly shrugged her shoulders Rapha.<br />
Being it Rapha of before, she wouldn’t even had an idea of making friends with AD. Hence, Lydia was rather glad.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go, Yuuyami?”<br />
“Yes.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami mount the tandem seat afore wrapping her arms around Lydia’s waist.<br />
Lydia brought the motorbike online,</p>

<p>“See you again, Rapha.”</p>

<p>Sent a sole glance at Rapha, whereafter pointed her gaze upon exit.</p>

<p>“Yes, right. See you.”</p>

<p>As soon as Rapha finished her phrase, Lydia twisted the throttle.<br />
Motorcycle leisurely came to advance forth.<br />
Ah-, this feeling; it’s been a while, thought Lydia.<br />
The feeling of running a motorcycle, whereas having Yuuyami behind.<br />
When the motorbike proceed to the surface, Ohan was standing nearby.<br />
Lydia rose her hand; Yuuyami greeted Ohan with mere glance.<br />
Ohan responded with slow elevating of his right hand.<br />
Lydia was exceedingly​ pleased with such. Former Ohan certainly would not have show any reaction.<br />
Everyone is changing. Growing.<br />
And Lydia, and Yuuyami likewise.<br />
At present, pair were in love with each other. Relationships between them has altered from before, ever so slightly.<br />
With that said, ostensibly however, it wore same appearance as before.<br />
And yet, the hearts of the pair certainly develop a  deep bond.</p>

<p>“Hey—, I’m going to challenge top-speed record!”<br />
“Good. Let us blow it up.”<br />
“Blow it up!?”<br />
“Was it bizarre?”<br />
“Mm—mm,” lightly shook her head Lydia. “I think it was good. Yuuyami usually so polite, I guess it’s good at times to throw a casual phrase.”<br />
“I see. Well, I shall be less formal henceforth, upon occasions.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Then let’s go-!”</p>

<p>Lydia opened a full throttle.<br />
Blowing wind, along with scenery, felt pleasant.<br />
Of course, there was also a presence of Yuuyami, pressing on my back.</p>
