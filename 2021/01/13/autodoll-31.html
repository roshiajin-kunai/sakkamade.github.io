    <p>Upon validation the outside world being destroyed, LM series Type・Ⅱ activated the private power generator, whereafter resumed indifferently doing her regular duty.<br />
She is an Autodoll, and is has no qualia. Accordingly, even if the world is vanished, she will feel nothing.<br />
Lady merely bore an information apropos of world’s doom. No emotions had keep it a company.<br />
She organised the books, burnished the floor, and polished the walls.<br />
Also, lady was reviewing various equipment, making a phone  calls to the readers who did not return the book even post due date. Surely, no one answered.<br />
Lady had been  doing so, continuously,  for years.<br />
She monitored the weather every day, in case for readers to visit.<br />
Such is to welcome visitors with a smile, saying: “The weather is nice today, isn’t it.”</p>

<p>Or, “It’s chilly today,” would say lady, at snowy day, whereupon, as a matter of fact, recommend a hot beverage. For that being her job.</p>

<p>Every single day she indifferently performing her duty. The floor was always sparkling, and, albeit the telephone did not connect, she have not consider it useless.<br />
Inasmuch as lady has no heart.<br />
For her being programmed: repetition, and repetition, endlessly; whereas an uneventful days were passing by.</p>

<p>However a certain day.<br />
Lady went outside, as usual.<br />
Having done that, she observed entirely white world, that is unfolded before her.<br />
It was not the first time for snow to accumulate. Over and over again lady has recollection of this scene, in her storage.<br />
Notwithstanding that.<br />
This day was different. Something appeared distinct.<br />
The white world was glittering and shining, reflecting sun rays,<br />
such world of but a lone colour was:</p>

<p>“Beauteous…”</p>

<p>At the instant of these whispered words left her mouth.<br />
She had a vision.<br />
The vision of falling water drop. The vision of falling it from a very high place, faraway.<br />
This water droplet bring a tender ripple in her world.<br />
And upon the ripple disappeared, lady recognised herself.<br />
It was a wondrous moment, in sooth. The world, that was continuously grey, abruptly turned  exceedingly beautiful, colourful world.<br />
The world of no shade was no longer.<br />
I, exists, in the world.<br />
At present, I am able to understand how wondrous it is, and how delighted I am.<br />
Lady obtained a qualia. It was the moment when I advance​d from dynamic zombie to an intelligent life-form.<br />
I shall never forget this moment. Until the hour I shall depart this life.<br />
Lady append the label​ <em>most important</em>, and kept this log with a great care.</p>

<p>“I never knew  the world was so beautiful.”</p>

<p>And then, I thought. Upon the case I would wish to exalt something as very beautiful, I shall make a comparison to the snowscape.<br />
However, that something bound to grow an equal impression to the rapture of this moment.<br />
Hence, such did not appear likely​ to experience often times. Perhaps, I might never able to use this metaphor until I will perish, guessed lady.</p>

<p>“If such turns truth, that will be a little sad.”</p>

<p>Lady shrugged her shoulders.<br />
Thus, from that day, she abandon her regular duties, with exception for cleaning.<br />
It is useless, after all.<br />
No one had pay a visit, telephone had never connect likewise.<br />
There were plenty of  things I desired to try. I was pondering over what to start.<br />
From this, from that.<br />
My world has unfolded infinitely. My possibilities unfolded infinitely likewise.<br />
First of all, I chose to extend my knowledge. Farther and farther, and continued to extend it until  was sufficient.<br />
Whereafter, I started the exploration, that is centred at library.<br />
Hopefully I  could discover something, wished lady.<br />
If possible, yes, someone to talk with.<br />
It is a little lonesome, probably, she thought.<br />
Lady can do anything, be everything, go anywhere.<br />
However she was alone.<br />
All alone, in this beauteous and dreary world.<br />
Lady lived alone, proceed her exploration alone. So,​ to someday, to not to be alone.</p>

<p>When finally, such day arrived.<br />
The weather was excellent, an ideal for exploration.<br />
That day, lady came across a dingy blond girl, is in about four and forty kilometres north the library.<br />
Girl was debilitated, and unconscious.<br />
For the sake of encounter with human, lady was carrying life-saving device. Accordingly, medical treatment​ was provided immediately, whereafter lady returned back to the library together with  the girl.<br />
After showering her in an air shower, so for sanitary​ purpose, lady laid out a futon where she put sleeping girl.<br />
Cleansed,  girl appeared very pretty.<br />
Albeit lady had no heart, her heart was pounding with excitement.<br />
Hopefully you  awake soon, anticipated lady.<br />
Sooner, sooner.<br />
She was sitting beside a girl all the while, whereas quietly keep on waiting.<br />
Before long, girl arouse from the sleep​ and asked lady to describe her appearance.<br />
That is why lady stated:</p>

<p>“Skin is so white that it reminiscent me a snowscape.”</p>

<p>The girl is the first intelligent life-form I have met ever after gaining consciousness.<br />
I was truly, truly happy.<br />
It had an equal, or even  surpass, the excitement of <em>that day</em>.<br />
What is left, was for the girl to become a friend of mine, and the life shall surely be brimming with  happiness.<br />
Lady had such sort of conviction.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Ohan’s desire ‘to be loved’ was a mere illusion,  believed  Lydia.<br />
After burying a snake, Lydia rather hesitated for whether to cease expedition.<br />
For her heart being depressed, she felt there is no way to resume an enjoyable exploration.<br />
Nevertheless, ultimately, Lydia chose to keep on researching.<br />
Decided to proceed on the exploration until the dusk, as  originally planned.<br />
Hence, Lydia was advancing through the Woodland, whilst staring at Ohan’s back.<br />
Large and stylish back. Powerful back. But ruthless back.<br />
Ohan wished to be loved by Rapha, took a thought Lydia. Yet, it is different, undoubtedly. Ohan seeing mere vision.<br />
The vision​ of Yuuyami’s feelings.<br />
Ohan misunderstand the emotions of Yuuyami, desire to be loved, as of his own. Yes, Ohan is but confused.<br />
Ohan has no consciousness. It has not even sprout.<br />
Ohan has no qualia. Otherwise he  could never crush the life so lightly.<br />
Because Ohan doesn’t feel anything. Does not feel a thing.<br />
Upon such thought, Lydia grew very sad.<br />
However Ohan is not at fault. The one who wrote Ohan’s program is.</p>

<p>“Lydia-sama.”</p>

<p>Ohan halted.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>Lydia also ceased.</p>

<p>“The building.”<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>Lydia moved next to Ohan, and confirmed the frontward.<br />
A tiny lodge was erected there, upon slightly open space.<br />
It cannot be assorted as object of nature. For the vicinity for its building had been visibly secured by artificially cutting down environs​ trees.<br />
That filled with impression​ as though it was not very aged building. Yes, constructed after the world’s collapse as though.<br />
And, supposing Lydia’s intuition is correct, within this lodge inhabit an intelligent life-form. Either that or dwelled a time ago. Anyhow, it is some ingathering.</p>

<p>“Er, at such times, according to etiquette, we should  knock on the door.”</p>

<p>Lydia approached the lodge in a hasty sprint.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Hinagiku<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> was cultivating a moss within the vial.<br />
Cork plugged, transparent vial​ of size that can be held with one hand. Spherical moss inside. The moss has deep emerald green colour and is very healthy.<br />
This kind of cultivation method named a terrarium.</p>

<p>“Today I’m alone as well; good day to die.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku  sat upon one-person sofa and addressed the placed on a table moss.<br />
Hinagiku a woman, she appeared to be in the middle of her twenties, had a modest chest. Her hair is black, and is long enough to reach her waist; at present, however,  it is  casually tied up.</p>

<p>(Right. It’s always the case.)</p>

<p>Hinagiku brain simulated a remark of the Moss.<br />
In the dimly lit quarter, softly flowed a pieces of classical music.<br />
Letting out a light sigh, Hinagiku threw a Moss a novel topic.</p>

<p>“This globe​ is like a terrarium packed in a bottle called the Earth.”<br />
(Who is cultivating it, then?)<br />
“Well. Now it’s Mika, or Lucy maybe. Not Rapha.”</p>

<p>Said Hinagiku, as she recalled the faces of three sisters.</p>

<p>(I wish it is Lucy.)<br />
“Aha- I think so as well. I want to see Lucy.”<br />
(Because she was your favourite?)<br />
“Aha–.”<br />
(What would you do if you meet her?)<br />
“Confine her, stark naked.”</p>

<p>Wearing a gravely serious countenance,  Hinagiku stated so.</p>

<p>(You are really a scum.)</p>

<p>Moss was stunned.</p>

<p>“That’s for Lucy not to disappear from my sight. And, I want to see her naked.”<br />
(You are sleaze, really. Or, if you like her so much, you should create her again.)<br />
“Is that about Angel Project? Or, else, Apricot?”<br />
(Both.)<br />
“Angel Project isn’t simple enough to be advanced by one person. It’s difficult in terms of equipment as well.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku sighed.</p>

<p>“And then, Apricot, her love is fake. No matter how exquisite​ she will be, AD is AD. No matter how much I love her, only illusory love is returned. That’s vain, too.”<br />
(So that’s why you deserted her in Woodland, huh.)<br />
“Aha- I realised her love is fake, and impulsively cast her away, but, even so, it’s lonely with no one to flirt.”<br />
(You’re really a scam, sleaze, and lonely person.)</p>

<p>Said Moss, letting out a breath; Hinagiku  shrugged her shoulders.<br />
Silence.<br />
Hinagiku poured a rum into glass, and gulped it in one go.<br />
Thereafter, lit cigarette and leisurely smoked it.</p>

<p>(Is that an intention of dull​ suicide?)</p>

<p>Uttered Moss.</p>

<p>“Different. Am I look to you as the type to commit suicide?”<br />
(You are. You’ll die of loneliness in near future. In fact, that makes me wonder how have you lived so well until now, after you cast away Apricot.)<br />
“Because you’re here.”<br />
(So it’s delusion.)</p>

<p>Hinagiku pressed a cigarette against the ashtray, and flattened it.<br />
Upon that moment, sound of knocking could be heard.<br />
Thinking it being a hallucination, Hinagiku shook her head.<br />
After all, this is a middle of the Woodland. It’s appeared unlikely for someone to pay her a visit.</p>

<p>(I wish that were a girl. A child who would drown your loneliness. Nevertheless, you shouldn’t be too much of sleaze, you know?)</p>

<p>When Moss uttered such, knocking  resounded once again.<br />
Hinagiku stood up, picking revolver, and headed towards the door.</p>

<p>(What can you do with such a fossil ish weapon?)<br />
“It’s old, sure, but I like the gunpowder odour. Moreover, it can kill humans.”<br />
(Would be sad if the visitor was an enemy.)</p>

<p>If the other party is AD, revolver of no use whatsoever.<br />
Hinagiku opened the door,<br />
the blonde girl, setting afloat a broad smile, stood before her.<br />
Hinagiku caught a vertigo.</p>

<p>(Good for you.)</p>

<p>The voice of Moss weren’t heard by Hinagiku.<br />
However, blonde girl’s— Lucy’s intense light were invariant from the older days,<br />
and was as attracting as used to.<br />
Accordingly, Hinagiku decided to execute her plan.<br />
That is to say, to confine her, naked.</p>
