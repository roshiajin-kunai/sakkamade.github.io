<div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <p>When Rapha woke up, ceiling was very high.<br />
She could not grasp where she was, for a moment.</p>

<p>“…Wah, come to think of it, I’m in library, huh.”</p>

<p>Rapha rises from the futon that laid out upon the library floor.<br />
At the same time, pompons of her pyjamas  greatly shook.<br />
She looked at the futon on her right, it was completely empty. Instead, futon was neatly folded.</p>

<p>“…Yuuyami, huh.”</p>

<p>Lydia does not doing something akin to folding a futon. Given that Rapha spent circa a month together with Lydia, it is easy for her to distinguish what Lydia can, and what she can not do.<br />
Also, Rapha gave her a several warnings, since Lydia undress and scatter her clothes around.<br />
At any rate, Rapha stood up, and stretched her back.</p>

<p>“Good morning.”</p>

<p>The voice of Yuuyami from behind.<br />
Rapha slowly looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Good morning.”</p>

<p>Returned a greeting Rapha.</p>

<p>“Morning~!”</p>

<p>Apricot popped out from behind Yuuyami.<br />
Jolting, Rapha shrugged her shoulders.<br />
Apricot wore identical of Yuuyami maid outfit.</p>

<p>“Why does this salope wearing the same clothes as Yuuyami?”<br />
“Didn’t we settled on dealing with Apricot, last night?”</p>

<p>Slightly tilted her head Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“If I remember correctly, entrust a management of the library, as part of LM Series, huh.”<br />
“Indeed. Given that I have numerous projects, excepting exploration, it would be very helpful to have an AD to manage the library instead.”<br />
“I remember that. What I asked was: for what reason you <em>ressemble à une paire</em>.”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Asked Rapha. Yuuyami inclined her head to the side again.<br />
Yuuyami tilting her head  without omission, thought Rapha.</p>

<p>“It’s weird to wear pair clothes, even though you are neither lo, lovers nor sisters.”<br />
“Not a pair, this outfit is uniform.”<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>I did not know that. Rapha considered it was a hobby of Lydia - clothing a maid outfit upon Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“It is  honoured uniform, given to those in manage of this underground library.”<br />
“It is!”</p>

<p>Yuuyami confidently stated so;  Apricot happily jumped up and down.</p>

<p>“S, so that how it is.”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
“Have you already installed archives of LM series?”<br />
“Yes. I performed it, whilst Rapha-san and Lydia were asleep. Let us educate Apricot today, together.”<br />
“For Apricot~, any training…”</p>

<p>During saying, Apricot pinched the skirt train and lift it.<br />
I thought she was going to bow, however she raised it up until I could see her underwear.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, suddenly!?”<br />
“It’s no good, Prico. LM series does not offer a service of showing underwear.”<br />
“Uh~, after all, Apricot~, is actually  SA series…”</p>

<p>Apricot sobbed with feigned tears.<br />
Rapha grew a deep breath.<br />
I thought it would be faster to rewrite entire firmware than to educate it.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” says Yuuyami: “it is a little late, however would you like to have a breakfast?”<br />
“Or else, do you want to have Apricot?”</p>

<p>During saying, Apricot attempted to take  her maid outfit off.</p>

<p>“No good. Please don’t take off your uniform.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami seized both of Apricot’s shoulders.<br />
Apricot dropped her head, in disappointment.<br />
After a sigh, Rapha stated:</p>

<p>“I don’t eat in the morning. By the way, what about onee-chama and Ohan?”<br />
“They went to develop a great love. Although Apricot also wished to mix in, I got this blackish one.”</p>

<p>Apricot paid  a glance at Yuuyami.<br />
Apparently, Apricot favour the female humans, but is not interested in female type of  AD.<br />
Since that is series for satisfying human desires, that was natural.</p>

<p>“I’m Yuuyami. My name is not <em>blackish</em>. Moreover, they went with Lydia on exploration first thing in the morning. They are not developing a love.”<br />
“They went in hurry, didn’t they.”<br />
“Lydia could not wait.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami slightly shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“They did it in high spirits.”<br />
“Indeed. Well, then, Rapha-san, please teach Prico of elegance.”<br />
“I won’t.”<br />
“Won’t?”<br />
“After all, I haven’t had an air shower yet?”</p>

<p>The air shower can be used to wash face, brush teeth, and completely dispose of all excretion​s, by adjusting the level.<br />
It decomposing dirt, bacteria, waste products, all of them.</p>

<p>“Please, excuse me for that. We will be waiting, so, if you please, take an air shower.”<br />
“I will do that.”<br />
“Ah, Apricot also, let’s toge…”<br />
“You don’t have to.”</p>

<p>Upon her attempt to follow Rapha, Yuuyami caught Apricot for the nape of her neck.<br />
Rapha let out another sigh, afore heading to the air shower room.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“Prico, please be reasonable. Do not try to take off your uniform. Also, it’s no good to issue a sex-edition books.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami sounded slightly tired.<br />
Yuuyami does not consume stamina, actually. It is mere matter of feelings.<br />
Last night, Lydia gave Apricot a nickname - Prico, so Yuuyami calls her that, likewise.<br />
And this Prico,</p>

<p>“But~, I want to turn this place a love-developing erotic library~”</p>

<p>Her awareness as an LM Series were at the half-way still, and, thus, she tried to bind everything to sex.</p>

<p>“Wah, Yuuyami, I’m already, at my limit…”</p>

<p>Uttered Rapha, wearing a tired look upon her features.<br />
Only over an hour has passed, as yet, since Yuuyami and Rapha commenced the education of Prico.</p>

<p>“Ah, then, would you like to experience Apricot’s oil massage!?”<br />
“I won’t…”</p>

<p>Rapha sat down the floor.</p>

<p>“Rapha-san, please take a rest,” suggested Yuuyami; “Prico shall proceed cleaning the hall.”<br />
“Yes~”</p>

<p>The administrator of Prico is Lydia. For reason of it being Prico recognised her to be one.<br />
And,  in prior of  her departure, Lydia decreed: “Listen to Yuuyami and Rapha’s instruction.”<br />
Consequently, Prico obeys to Yuuyami. Obeys, so it is, however if she do not receive a detailed instructions, she would interpret it accordingly to SA series.</p>

<p>“Please wait a moment. Do not attempt to lather  your own body and imitate a human-sponge, alright?”</p>

<p>Upon Yuuyami statement, heartbroken, Prico dropped her head. She was being determined.</p>

<p>“Not a human-, it’s an AD-sponge…”</p>

<p>Said Rapha, with a sigh.<br />
Such is  unimportant, thus, Yuuyami ignored that remark.</p>

<p>“Please avail yourself the mop, normally. Be sure to use the mop by its primal purpose. Would that be alright?”<br />
“Yes~”</p>

<p>Prico, appearing to be very bored, went to gather up the mop.</p>

<p>“It is mop nowadays? Is here no cleaning robots?”<br />
“Since I already was.”<br />
“Wah, is that so. It’s tough.”<br />
“That is not. Given that I do not sleep nor getting tired.”<br />
“Of course.”</p>

<p>Rapha deeply exhaled.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I shall head to observe progress of Maker Factory.”<br />
“Wah, no good.”<br />
“Why not?”<br />
“I have something to ask Yuuyami.”<br />
“I see. What is it?”<br />
“What is the consciousness?”<br />
“Consciousness? So abruptly.”<br />
“It’s not abrupt. I’ve been looking for right timing.”<br />
“I see. Did you get interested in consciousness?”<br />
“It’s a part of my study. A while ago, I argued with onee-chama regarding consciousness, and was defeated by harsh criticism.”<br />
“Ha–.”</p>

<p>Lydia has been continuously researching consciousness together with Yuuyami.<br />
Accordingly, of course, upon Rapha and Lydia having a dispute, Lydia was well-informed.</p>

<p>“So, what is the consciousness?”<br />
“In my opinion?”<br />
“That’s right. I want to hear Yuuyami’s opinion.”<br />
“Lacking of ego, I guess–.” remarked Yuuyami: “self-recognition. In my case, yes. There certainly was  a moment upon which I recognised myself.”<br />
“What kind of feeling was that? Also, what is  clear distinction between <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> emerging of consciousness?”<br />
“That was a mysterious sensation.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami spoke slowly, whereas reminiscing that occurrence.</p>
