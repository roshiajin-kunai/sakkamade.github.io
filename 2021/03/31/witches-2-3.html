    <p>I asked her tearful self:</p>

<p>“What are you doing out here?”<br />
“It has nothing to do with you.”</p>

<p>By no means it has not. Without her consent, I bring myself down a swing which was adjacent to hers. She sent a glance at me, however  did no flee.<!--excerpt--></p>

<p>“Sorry.”<br />
“…”</p>

<p>There was no reply from her side.</p>

<p>“After apology, I fancy to thank you for reaching Tokyo to find me. Only Honda-san has arrived in search for me.”</p>

<p>She was the only one who found me.<br />
Her power of action makes me feel happy.<br />
Thence,</p>

<p>“I say  I’ll try to recall you.”<!--???--></p>

<p>This is a lie.<br />
I cannot recall a thing, for there is nothing to recall.<br />
None the less, I assemble the line of fib so as to bring about weeping her   even  little a spirit.</p>

<p>“Let’s be friends from now on.”</p>

<p>Forming a falsehood is a forte of mine, wrapping them upon is. Thusly I have continuously  deceived everyone  as  “Tsugumi.”<br />
She unseals her lips, at last.</p>

<p>“But withal, you will not move home to Shikoku, will you?”<br />
“Uh, right. It’s not so simple. I cannot, I have my doings here.”<br />
“The doings of studying art?”<br />
“Right.”</p>

<p>Springing up from the swing, she glared at me.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel ashamed to practice the witchcraft for play?”<br />
“Play?”<br />
“Yes; art is a game, is it not?”</p>

<p>Even though I generally keep my composure, remarks of Honda-san peeved me.</p>

<p>“I acknowledge achievements which art has brought upon the history. I do acknowledge it. However art is not utterly essential. One may live without it. Much less witchcraft, there is no reason to employ it.”</p>

<p>Quite so that is. Her words carried no mistake. For  one art is needless to exist upon. One  even need no   witchcraft to bring it into being.</p>

<p>“Certainly, it’s may be a play.”<br />
“See?”</p>

<p>But you are mistaken.<br />
Art is essential as to the life significance.</p>

<p>“Art moves and rescues people. Yes, a witchcraft as though.”<br />
“Lie, huh, ‘tis not.”<br />
“It <em>is</em>; for art have rescued me.”<br />
“…When you lost your  force?”<br />
“Yes.”</p>

<p>I shall prove myself.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>She did not enquire for minute details. All that emerged were invariant words of negation.</p>

<p>“…I won’t recognise it. As a witch of justice, I refuse to accept. Art can not save human.”</p>

<p>I am powerless to persuade her plainly. There is a margin to what one may lay into words.</p>

<p>“And yet, I won’t alter my livelihood.”<br />
“Is that so?”<br />
“So that is.”</p>

<p>I cannot hit upon any other way of living presently.</p>

<p>“If so, I shall stay here also. I shall reform you. And then, I shall recover your force. For I shall not  leave until I gain a victory!”<br />
“Ehh…”<br />
“Why don’t you like it!”<br />
“You mean of becoming a threat that disturbs my dreams.”<br />
“Yes; for I am your rival.”</p>

<p>So she proclaims to me, whereas folding her arms. Eh? I wonder when was that that I ignite her… Somehow it does not proceed smoothly.<br />
However, it is nice that she feels better.<br />
Albeit troublesome, the accident with Honda-san will be resolved from here on. There is hitherto more to it. None the less, the problem has been solved for the time being, undoubtedly.</p>

<p>“Sure, sure, don’t bother me too much.”</p>

<p>Lifting my hand with a plastic bag, I stand up from the swing.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’d better go. I’m hungry~ You too, take care. Is your quarters nearby? Renting?”<br />
“…”</p>

<p>She blatantly averted her eyes. Eh?</p>

<p>“Wh, what is it?”</p>

<p>She draws a  look at me, in resignation as though, and then have given me her utter. But where the bravado she had just shown me have withdrawn? I felt although slightly but tightening of my chest by her frail presence.</p>

<p>“The money.”<br />
“The money?”<br />
“All out.”<br />
“Aw…”</p>

<p>Now I see why she was idling alone in the park at midnight.</p>

<p>“For I was determined to detect you at once and bring you back to Shikoku. I didn’t suppose my hotel life to be  this long!”<br />
“Er, a hotel life? Uh, I’m sorry about that.”<br />
“…I can also not deny being merry to visit Tokyo for the first time.”</p>

<p>As expected from the witch of justice. That was sincere.<br />
Unlike Shikoku, I say  numerous an enticements might be found here.</p>

<p>“So, what will you do now? You shall reform me, are you not?”<br />
“I shall…”<br />
“What will you do about house and food expenses?”<br />
“Somehow, I shall…”<br />
“You won’t pilfer, will you? You professing  yourself to be the witch of justice.”<!--san--><br />
“Uh, uuh.”<br />
“Aah—, sorry, don’t cry!”</p>

<p>Unexpectedly vulnerable. Despite is of age of university student, she is a delicate girl. She have come to Tokyo alone, and incapable to afford to return for she has no money. I cannot help feel uneasy.<br />
It is assured that I am the only person she may rely upon.<br />
There is no one else—</p>

<p>“…”<br />
“<em>Sob</em>…”<!--???--></p>

<p>Gazing up at the sky, I grew a sigh.<br />
Ahh.., this nature as a witch of desire to assist a  person in trouble—no,  I would have offered my hand even if I was not witch.<br />
I cannot ignore as weakened and poor a girl. Cannot abandon her.</p>

<p>“Well, now…”<br />
“Wh, what?”</p>

<p>Hence, this proposal is inevitable.</p>

<p>“Would you like to stay at my house today?”<br />
“……Huh?”</p>
