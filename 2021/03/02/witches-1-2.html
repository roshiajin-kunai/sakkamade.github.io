<div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <p>When I woke up, I felt as though being under the water. It was a little distinct a sensation of sinking below the water surface, or of deep-sea fish.<br />
Whereas suffocating, I cannot arise upwards. Whilst screaming out, my voice does not reach anywhere. The light is far away, I struggle, but my body is too  heavy.<br />
When, at the end, “Oh, well,” I find myself compromising amid that space.<br />
Upon some place, however, I would interrupt myself.<br />
Saying: “It’s no good!”<br />
That myself then would cast a spell upon me.<br />
Saying: “I wish today you will be the best of myself.”</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In spite of it is twenty-second a year of twenty first century, trains have not evolved for nearly twenty a years, as for linear motor cars—they were also yet to be under employment of the civilian world.<br />
Hence, up to present, humans consume their lives  viewing the scenery which they may follow from the windows still.</p>

<p>“Whew, finally here—.”</p>

<p>Entered the station, threw my hands upwards, stood on tiptoe, stretched my back out.<br />
For we had to gather on-site, it took several an hours of me to get on the train early in the morning. Arrived at the country station.<br />
As I exit the station, my sight penetrate a desolate town.<br />
Therein may be found no shops open for business, and of course no convenience stores. Even cars were seldom to pass by in the first place.<br />
And this is not yet the place of destination.</p>

<p>“Does a bus ride further?”</p>

<p>Let profanity outburst, for it was so void, however, no one had to listen to it.<br />
Today I make my way for the public aquarium as part of my university class. The project is to enliven the rural area with art.<br />
However, there is no one. Keeping my stand before the station,  no taxicabs were parked nigh. And upon a guidance nothing should be found regarding the public aquarium.<br />
I figured the outcome afore paying aquarium a visit.<br />
This battle we doomed to lose.<br />
Perhaps that is why they have passed this project to us—students of not-so-famous university. Clutching at straws? Otherwise out of desperation?<br />
According to the  guidance, a solitary bus set off every an hour.<br />
Fortunately, the bus had just approached, thus I was able to board without waiting. Eh? if I could not get on this thing, would I have had to await for an hour in the middle of nowhere?<br />
I say I should have done some preparation in advance, but bless my piece of luck.</p>

<p>“There is nothing whatever, eh…”</p>

<p>My anxiety had hitherto not abate upon boarding a bus. The view which came to my sight from the window grew more and more rural, and it became difficult to spot a ploughed field, let alone stores.<br />
And then I finally reached the “Ishihama Aquarium.” It is undoubtedly that the sea is in the vicinity, however no plage  assumed for swimming, nor fishermen have made their reside thereat.</p>

<p>“I want to go home.”</p>

<p>With that said, I alighted the bus and proceed forth.<br />
Upon my arrival to the entrance of the building, several a students  along with a teacher were already on the spot.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are here, Kominato-kun.”</p>

<p>Am I not allowed to come?<br />
Even professor has such disposition. I believe they have thought I would not put in an appearance for I had not been motivated. Uh-huh, I believe the correct choice was not to present myself.<br />
Upon a handclap, teacher addressed us.</p>

<p>“Err—, I think I won’t be coming back. Well, let me explain your today’s project.”<br />
“Whee—!”</p>

<p>I attempt to return a <em>party people</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> reply, however surrounding me  students sent me but a blank stares. I thought I could at least brighten the mood up, but no one get on with it. Students nowadays are not too flippant, eh? So that is why they named me well-informed.</p>

<p>“At the request of the aquarium, we need to originate an art project that should attract customers. Best wishes.”<br />
“Eh? that’s it?”<br />
“Uh-huh, if one were to set restrictions, it would stifle your liberty of thought, right?”</p>

<p>Mhm, mhm, refusal of leadership. What a terrible professor we were given. I should not care if they slander me on social media.</p>

<p>“The ones who appeared here today shall be exempt from intermediate assignment​.”</p>

<p>I should retrieve my previous commentary. What a nice professor! Exemption from assignment by so much as attendance—wonderful. Hopefully the other teachers would follow a suit.</p>

<p>“The last bus will depart at six in the afternoon, so think about it until then, and write a formal report. Because the good ones will actually be implemented. Now, start—!”</p>

<p>What a wholesome​ location to be in, with the bus at six in the climax. I am actually having no mind to go sightseeing.<br />
Students has dispersed around, and the class had began.<br />
Yosh, how shall I skip it out?<br />
As I was thinking upon it, I was called from behind.</p>

<p>“Wah, it’s Kominato-san. Glad to see you—!”</p>

<p>A girl clad in a white dress does not fit these desolate hereabouts.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Ma, Maejima-san.”</p>

<p>As one would expect, I have not forgotten your name since yesterday. Maejima… Noriko. Wah, I didn’t forget it.</p>

<p>“What a coincidence.”<br />
“What a coincidence, indeed. I would never have thought I’ll meet you in a place like this.”</p>

<p>For we are students of the same grade, it was not so much a coincidence, however Maejima-san bore a delighted visage.<br />
Good, good for you.</p>

<p>“Well then, now I shall have a siesta elsewhere.”<br />
“Please wait a moment Kominato-san.”</p>

<p>Arrested me by a rucksack, obstructing me from moving forward.<br />
Looking behind myself in atwitter, there was smiling Maejima-san—<br />
e, eerie. In spite of smile, I perceive an aura from which no one may possibly escape.<!-- flight off --></p>

<p>“Wh, what is it?”<br />
“Shall we go around together, Kominato-san?”<br />
“No, thank you.”<br />
“We’re going around together, are we not, Kominato-san.”<br />
“…Yes.”</p>

<p>I could not make my escape for I had no part-time job to-day.<br />
This child holds a potent impact!<br />
However, there is nothing interesting in strolling around together with me. I am waste a time partner, eh—.</p>

<p>“Then let’s go, Kominato-san!”<br />
“Mhm, all right.”</p>

<p>I have no choice but to follow after her.<br />
And thus the aquarium survey had  commenced.</p>
