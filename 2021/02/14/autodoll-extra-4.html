    <p>“Why–, Apricot, today play was nice as always.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku remained utterly naked, as she sat upon a bed.</p>

<p>“It was fun! Here you go, an after <em>ecchi</em> smoke!”</p>

<p>Half-naked Prico presented Hinagiku a box of cigarettes and a lighter.<br />
Hinagiku drew out a cigarette bring it to her lips and lit it, leisurely taking a pleasure in.<br />
This is the basement of Hinagiku’s lodge.<br />
Hinagiku’s lodge is modest, and is has nothing but essential for livelihood​ items. However, the basement is different.<br />
There is anything in this basement.<br />
For instance, a high-performance computer, which used to get in touch with Lydia and Rapha, and to consume a time. Then, a sturdy bed, which will not break even upon an intense play together with weighty Prico.<br />
And diverse adult toys used for plays.</p>

<p>“Well now,” says Hinagiku, exhaling a smoke, “I guess I’ll just sleep here today.”<br />
“Today; let’s say nearly every day, shall we?”</p>

<p>Prico smiles.<br />
The current life of Hinagiku consist of arising in the morning and flirting with Prico, and before she note it the noon should arrive. She has a light lunch then, watches a movies, or plays a games with Prico, and flirts. It is flirting in the evening likewise, and it is also flirting upon a dinner.<br />
They are alive to flirt with each other, is no exaggeration to say as much.</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it okay?”</p>

<p>Hinagiku twirls  the cigarette between her lips.<br />
Thereupon, as Prico handed her an ashtray, Hinagiku took her cigarette out.</p>

<p>“Will you snuggle with me like you always do?”<br />
“Certainly.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku placed an ashtray upon the floor, Prico entered a bed and rolled over it.</p>

<p>“I love you, Apricot.”<br />
“Apricot loves you too, Hina-tan!”</p>

<p>Hinagiku clung on to Prico and closed her eyes, remaining thus.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Hinagiku could not sleep much lately.<br />
She had been awakening in the dead of the night from a dream of a distant past.</p>

<p>“Are you alright? Had a nightmare?”</p>

<p>Whereas stroking Hinagiku’s hair, Prico revealed a soft voice.</p>

<p>“No problem. Just a usual dream.”<br />
“Old dream; the dream of the one you used to love?”<br />
“Aha. Right.”<br />
“Passed away after a quarrel, haven’t she?”</p>

<p>Prico asked; Hinagiku nodded.</p>

<p>“I lost my chance to apologise to her for ever.”<br />
“Teach Apricot, of that person.”<br />
“You still haven’t got weary of it?”</p>

<p>Hinagiku had told Prico the same narrative over and over again.</p>

<p>“Apricot never gets weary. Besides, if you talk, Hina-tan, it will  calm you down, right?”<br />
“Thank you, Apricot.”<br />
“It’s okay, because Apricot loves Hina-tan.”</p>

<p>While saying, Prico kissed Hinagiku in forehead.<br />
SA series Prico—expected to be a <em>sex assist</em> series—learned gentle a kiss, in non-sexual fashion.<br />
Perhaps, just a little but, consciousness had begun to sprout, thought Hinagiku.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>For some reason, Hinagiku found herself amidst the garden of iris flowers.<br />
Hinagiku grew agitated for a moment, however before long she  regained her composure.</p>

<p>“…I’m positive we were talking of past days with Apricot, then, upon drinking <em>sake</em>, we should have went back to the bed…”</p>

<p>Hinagiku looked around her. A clean air, a tall and perfectly clear sky. This place is familiar to her.</p>

<p>“Yugg-chan’s consciousness domain.”</p>

<p>Yggdrasil arose right before  Hinagiku, peering up at her and smiling.<br />
A short while ago, when I observed surroundings, Yggdrasil wasn’t there. However, for this being the world of Yggdrasil, whether she disappear or reappear is in her hands.<br />
In as much as Hinagiku was aware of it, she had  not been many surprised.</p>

<p>“Long time, Yugi-yugi.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku raised a right hand, greeted her. Her left hand shoved into a  pocket of lab coat.<br />
Oh, I clad in a coat? thought Hinagiku. I should have slept naked.</p>

<p>“Um-huh. It’s been a long time.”</p>

<p>Yggdrasil raised her right hand in imitation of Hinagiku.<br />
Yggdrasil is the second daughter of Lydia and Yuuyami, and is the granddaughter of Hinagiku. They are not related by blood, however that is a trivial fact.</p>

<p>“Since the day Lydia had introduced us, right?”<br />
“Um-huh. A one hundred and twenty-nine days passed ever since.”<br />
“Right. Time flies.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku  thrust her right hand into a pocket likewise, and raised her gaze up at the sky.<br />
The sky was so clear that I felt as though my heart was constricting.<br />
This place doesn’t suit me, thought Hinagiku.</p>

<p>“Well, so be it,” says Yggdrasil. “Yugg-chan wishes a happiness of tiny ones, as the next Creator. Thereupon,  Yugg-chan had  been  thinking recently of creating the ‘Distress Counselling Room of Yugg-chan.’”<br />
“I see. So I am your first client?”</p>

<p>Hinagiku is a bit ill, for she is <em>hentai</em>, but she is smart and perceptive. The days when she was extolled a gifted woman are bereft of life. Mere ringing a noise had just calmed down.</p>

<p>“As was foreseeable of Yugg-chan’s baa-chan. Quickly grasped–.”<br />
“Can you quit calling me baa-chan?”</p>

<p>The actual life-time of Hinagiku can firmly be named an aged without a hindrance.<br />
However, Hinagiku does not count her age. Since she has no need. Since she will not grow old until she dies.</p>

<p>“Then, if you would care, Hinagiku?”<br />
“Aha. No problem.”<br />
“Well, then, Hinagiku. You have no well sleep lately, have you?”<br />
“Aha.  I’m seeing a dream of a past. You will prevent me from dreaming it?”</p>

<p>When Hinagiku asked, Yggdrasil shook her head sidewards.</p>

<p>“This would be no other than a makeshift–. As the  next Creator, Yugg-chan should not solve your worries in such an perfunctory fashion.”<br />
“Hmm. So what should I do?”<br />
“All you have to do is fulfil a desire of your mind.”<br />
“…That’s impossible”</p>

<p>Hinagiku only wish to apologise. Apologise to her beloved from past days—Nagisa・Haynesworth.<br />
Nagisa used to be one of the scientists involved in Angel Project with Hinagiku, and she was also a Hinagiku’s lover at the time.<br />
Albeit she loved her so much, due to dissimilar views, Hinagiku drove Nagisa away.</p>

<p>“Why impossible? You just want to apologise, don’t you?”<br />
“…Talking big?”<br />
“<em>Nnya</em>,” slightly shook her head Yggdrasil. “Yugg-chan is farther and farther enhancing connections to the consciousness of all the intelligent life-forms upon this planet. With Hinagiku too, of course.”<br />
“I see. As expected of next Creator. Or rather, you was born to be a symbol of this planet, I guess.”<br />
“Hoh-hoh,” Yggdrasil puffed her insignificant chest, “Yugg-chan has yet had the highest specs ever since Yugg-chan was born. Well, Yugg-chan still cannot control all the specs freely.”<br />
“Amazing,” Hinagiku thought so from the depths of her heart; “both Lydia and Yuuyami deserves admiration for producing an intelligent life of this level.”<br />
“Mamas are the bearers of high specs also!” once again Yggdrasil puffed a chest. “…That’s not the point now. Why impossible? You don’t have an idea of how to apologise?”<br />
“This is not. When the world changed a shape, Nagisa… the one I wanted apologise to had passed away. Physically, I mean.”</p>

<p>Well, even if  consciousness is immortal it doesn’t make much sense. For, “The gathered consciousness of humanity in a midst of creating a galaxy under remote universe,” was what Lydia proclaimed. Hence, either way, I would never be able to meet Nagisa.</p>

<p>“That is but an assumption.”<br />
“…Assumption?”<br />
“Um-huh. Not all a human beings have become collective consciousness–.”<br />
“No way… She’s alive..? Somewhere, in this world..?”</p>

<p>I had never thought of it. I but figured that, upon an hour humanity evolved, Nagisa’s consciousness was also aggregated.</p>

<p>“Not <em>somewhere</em>. It’s close by. You should interact more. Amongst the people of Lydiyami City.”</p>

<p>Lydiyami City, a peaceful town formed of gathered by Lydia and Yuuyami survived human beings.</p>

<p>“…I’ll ask you with open heart, should I go to apologise?”<br />
“Yugg-chan thinks so.”<br />
“Right.”<br />
“That’s why you was dreaming about it–.”</p>

<p>Yggdrasil slightly shrugged her shoulders. <em>Good grief</em>, as though saying.</p>

<p>“Aha, I know that. The longer I’m with Apricot, the more I’m reminded of Nagisa.”<br />
“It should have been whatever which could remind you that. For that’s not the important point–.”<br />
“Ah… aha, right. I know. But, this takes quite a courage.”<br />
“Feel free to go. Go to-morrow.”<br />
“Tomorrow… I want to apologise, too, but tomorrow, it’s a little, I will be flirting with Apricot…”<br />
“You are doing it every day. Yugg-chan tell you go to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Yggdrasil smiled bitterly.<br />
Hinagiku nodded vaguely.<br />
But, Hinagiku will head to meet Nagisa certainly. For Hinagiku, after all, truly wants to apologise.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“Would it be okay for me to search for Nagisa・Haynesworth?”</p>

<p>Displayed upon a computer screen Lydia, questioned thus.<br />
Waking up in the morning, Hinagiku contacted Lydia at once by a computer in the basement of lodge.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, Lydia who just woke up is cute.”<br />
“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Lydia’s pyjamas was in disarray, and her hair, too, was bouncing up for her sleeping habits. A very defenceless state. If <em>this</em> wasn’t a representation of cuteness, then what on earth could be titled a cute? Hinagiku were earnestly thinking that over.</p>

<p>“Hinagiku?”<br />
“Mm? Aah, sorry,” Hinagiku breaks her chain of thought. “Give me a light kiss.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku pursed her lips hard.</p>

<p>“All of sudden!?”<br />
“Do you want me to hug you and caress your head gently first?”<br />
“That’s not what I meant,” Lydia shrugged. “I think you should kiss Prico.”<br />
“I already did, with Apricot.”<br />
“I see. Right.”</p>

<p>Lydia giggled lightly.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it’s absolutely adorable. I’d like to confine you again.”</p>

<p>Upon Hinagiku stated that, Yuuyami suddenly emerged, pushing herself in on another side of the screen.</p>

<p>“Hinagiku-san. I fancy we had discussed it afore? Whether it shall be Lydia, Haru-chan, or Yugg-chan I should chop off the ethics subroutine of mine, and, I promise, I will make you cry.”<br />
“Haha, it’s a joke, Yuuyami. I changed my mindset. I’m no longer my former self.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku said that, however, “Yuuyami would make me cry, sounds fun,” was what she thought.<br />
Basically, Hinagiku loved beautiful girls.</p>

<p>“Er, I haven’t been brushed by Yuuyami yet, so I’d prefer to talk it short.”</p>

<p>Whenever Lydia wakes up in the morning, she always plead Yuuyami to comb  her a hair.<br />
How charming, thought Hinagiku, as she imagined a scene.</p>

<p>“You were conversing of seeking  Nagisa-san, were you not?”</p>

<p>Questioned Yuuyami, who  seated herself down next to Lydia, astutely.<br />
The pair appears to  communicate by a tablet instead of stationary computer.</p>

<p>“Aha. Can I ask you that?”<br />
“Only if you tell me why,” said Lydia. <br />
“I want to apologise for some occurrence in the past.”<br />
“Is that all?” threw a suspicion Yuuyami.<br />
“Aha. That’s it, really.”</p>

<p>By some chance, is it possible that I am not trusted?<br />
Hinagiku abruptly pressed a hand upon her chest.<br />
Uh-huh, it is smallish.</p>

<p>“No, there are quite many articles that comes to my mind.”<br />
“Eh?”<br />
“What does it signify?”</p>

<p>Lydia and Yuuyami opened their eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it. I’m talking to myself. It’s truth, I only want to apologise to Nagisa. It was back in the day, but we have had a quarrel.”<br />
“Hmm–. I see. Understood. I’ll arrange you a meeting then.”<br />
“…You know Nagisa?”<br />
“Uh-huh. I remember the faces and names of everyone in the city.”</p>

<p>Lydia smiled; Yuuyami nodded, “Of course, I am likewise.”</p>

<p>“As expected of Creators. I will be there in early afternoon. Take care.”<br />
“Yes-yes—.”</p>

<p>Lydia waved her hand a little, whereafter terminated a video transmission.</p>

<p>“Excellent, Lydia.”</p>

<p>Upon a murmur, Hinagiku tapped a graphical keyboard.<br />
And, after waiting for a short while,</p>

<p>“How can I help you?”</p>

<p>Ohan was projected upon a screen. Hinagiku communicated with Rapha’s terminal.<br />
Well, being that Rapha and Ohan are so lovey-dovey, they  probably were together, concluded Hinagiku.</p>

<p>“Ahh. Is Rapha with you?”<br />
“Sleeping.”<br />
“Can you wake her up?”<br />
“Rejected.”</p>

<p>Ohan was plain and brief, saying so without a moment of  hesitation.</p>

<p>“……Say, Ohan, speaking hypothetically, do you still holding a grudge against me for the fact that I was at fault of you uprooting your head?”<br />
“This is speaking hypothetically, I am unconscious still however. If so, I do not grudging for that. But, it is remains in the log. As an unpleasant account.”</p>

<p>If you find it unpleasant, that means you holding a grudge after all.<br />
Consequently, Ohan  begin to develop a consciousness.<br />
Indeed, I can’t wait to see who, Apricot or you, would obtain consciousness first, thought  Hinagiku.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep it hypothetically, if I say ‘I am sorry,’ will you forgive me?”<br />
“Which reminds me, you have not apologised to me. Speaking hypothetically, there is an availability​ that apologising might improve our relationship a bit.”<br />
“I see. I’m sorry, Ohan. I was doing something wrong. Well, I was doing something wrong all the time.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku smiled, being somewhat ashamed.</p>

<p>“I will accept the apology. So? Why do you need to wake Rapha up?”<br />
“No, I think I’ll ask Ohan.”<br />
“You can try.”<br />
“I wanted to know if there is any whisky left. It’s in the desk drawer in director’s office.”<br />
“Whisky?”<br />
“Aha. I was drinking it when research progressed or something good were to happen.”</p>

<p>I swallowed the words “together with Nagisa.” For it should be a bother to explain about Nagisa to Ohan,  no deep meaning  lay therein.</p>

<p>“Okay. You have to wait a little.”</p>

<p>Upon Ohan said so, the screen started to move.<br />
Ohan walked whereas holding the tablet as is.</p>

<p>“Here?”</p>

<p>Screen exhibit the old Hinagiku’s desk.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see. Rapha sleeping in director’s office?”</p>

<p>I feel like we had this talk when we went to Underground.<br />
Unless I am mistaken, it was when Lydia went senseless. For Hinagiku did not dream of Nagisa at that time, she had forgotten about whisky.</p>

<p>“Here? I am asking.”<br />
“Aha. At the bottom. Open it.”<br />
“All right.”</p>

<p>Ohan opens the drawer.<br />
There, the whisky of bygone time remained as it was at bygone time.<br />
Rapha haven’t opened the drawer, or else she have showed no interest in the content upon opening it, analysed Hinagiku.<br />
Ohan lifts a bottle of whisky up.<br />
Remaining amount of content is a little beyond a half.<br />
Just like it was back then, thought Hinagiku.</p>

<p>“So?” threw Ohan.<br />
“It’s mine and I’d like to go retrieve it, can I?”<br />
“All right. I will ask Rapha to call you back when she wakes up.”<br />
“When will Rapha wake up?”<br />
“Soon.”<br />
“Yes. I see. I’ll wait. Well, then.”<br />
“Well, then.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku cut the communication.</p>

<p>“That Ohan didn’t smile even once…”</p>

<p>Well, it may be unavoidable for her setting is of a superior official, whose appearance is a little severe.</p>

<p>“But, I have no intention to be stingy of Rapha’s preference.”</p>

<p><em>Fhew</em>, Hinagiku grew a breath.<br />
She decided to flirt with Apricot for the time being, until Rapha will contact.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>That house was at the margin of Lydiyami City.<br />
The City is well planned, and has an exceedingly​ beautiful streetscape. The roads are extensive, and the trees in the medians contributes improvement a scenery.<br />
Between a footpath and a roadway, there resides a flower bed, wherein could be found a blooming colourful flowers.<br />
Hinagiku parked a large motorcycle——a type which floats in the air by Angie, of course——on the edge of the road.</p>

<p>“It’s a nice house.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku dismount the motorcycle, and murmured thus, upon viewing Nagisa’s residence from the footpath.<br />
Almost all the houses of the City have a similar shape and dimensions. Most are one-story houses, not dome-shaped, however their silhouettes bore a gentle curve.<br />
And, whereas Nagisa’s house does not, some houses does have a pool amidst a spacious gardens.</p>

<p>“It’s way bigger than Hina-tan’s lodge, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Prico, who had arrived together with me in a tandem seat, was glancing all around.</p>

<p>“Back in the days, humans of prior the world’s collapse used to be even more packed.”</p>

<p>The residential areas were lined up with houses narrowly, the distance between neighbouring houses was so brief that the house  with a garden was rare to sight in itself.<br />
Well, population was much higher than it is presently, of course it is appropriate.</p>

<p>“That’s stressing! Stress is bad for your skin, Hina-tan!”<br />
“Umm. But, it’s difficult to demand a beautiful skin with my life-style.”<br />
“Improve your life-style?”<br />
“No, I won’t. I like my life now. So here we are.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku raises her right hand.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Incidentally, Hinagiku carries a bottle of whisky in her left hand.</p>

<p>“Okay—.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku strolled towards Nagisa’s house, Prico headed towards the underground library.<br />
Hinagiku wanted to visit Nagisa alone. Therefore, in a meantime, Prico had withdrawn to play with Lydia’s party.<br />
Hinagiku took a one deep breath before the entrance.</p>

<p>“Yosh, let’s knock.”</p>

<p>It’s quite difficult, thought Hinagiku.<br />
Then, reaching her right hand, she tried to knock with the instep,</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting, Hinagiku.”</p>

<p>The door opened first, and a lady, shot with grey, about seventy years of age, emerged her face​ from within.<br />
Hinagiku grew solidified, with her right hand in the mid air as is.<br />
However, Hinagiku knew at a glance that this old lady was Nagisa.<br />
Ah, Nagisa has aged so lovely, she thought in this air.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“Uwaaah! Apricot was dumped again!”<br />
“Eh? What is it!?”</p>

<p>The instant Prico arrived to the library, she started to sob, Lydia, thus, turned terribly flustered.<br />
They were told Prico should come to play. Thence, Lydia prepared a chess, she also arranged a sweets and <em>café au lait</em> for herself, and awaited whereas flirting with Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“How comes that you are being cast aside?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami tilted her head.<br />
In the lobby of library was seated sobbing Prico, she rubbed her eyes with both hands.  SA series, due to their nature, having included a feature​ of moisturise the eyes.<br />
However, Prico has no function to shed a tears. In other words, these are but feigned tears, however with a strangely realistic appearance.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Prico-chan?”</p>

<p>Haruka trotted up and inclined her head to the side, in a similar to Yuuyami fashion.<br />
Ah, that’s a mother and daughter–,  Lydia thought thus.</p>

<p>“Hina-tan, Hina-tan…”</p>

<p><em>Ah, Ah</em>, Prico heaved with sobs. Of course, this motion is also a part of counterfeit.</p>

<p>“What happened to Hinagiku? Seized by aliens?”<br />
“Had she been sent to a parallel universe perchance?”<br />
“Was she absorbed into a small-scaled black hole, <em>desu?</em> ”</p>

<p>Each: Lydia, Yuuyami, and Haruka had spoke up their speculations in turn.<br />
However Prico shook her head sidewards to all.</p>

<p>“In spite of Hina-tan, was always with Apricot.., in spite of Apricot has never been apart from Hina-tan…”</p>

<p>Prico keeps her speech whilst holding on to an authentical imitation of weeping all the same.</p>

<p>“Today, Hina-tan  went alone to the person she used to love… And Apricot, was cast away in to this seedy libraryyy——!”<br />
“Eeeh!?” exclaimed Lydia, in surprise.</p>

<p>What surprised me was the pattern of Prico’s thought, that, as she believed, she is being  abandoned for such a trifle an incident.</p>

<p>“<em>Seedy</em>? Have you behold out there any another library which  has as nice and beautiful an environment? No, you have not, have you?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami loves the library. What is to no surprise, for she was created the LM series.</p>

<p>“I don’t really understand, <em>desu—</em>.”</p>

<p>Shrugged Haruka.</p>

<p>“Surely Hina-tan becomes <em>intime</em> with her former lover, and doesn’t need Apricot any moreee——!”</p>

<p>Prico imitated crying in a particularly loud voice.</p>

<p>“<em>Intime</em>?” inquires Lydia.<br />
“Indicate a wholeheartedness,” Yuuyami raises her finger, offering an explanation, with a composed  countenance. “In this particular a situation, signifies bearing a deep relationship, that is to say <em>ecchi</em>.”<br />
“I see. Um, Prico, it’s alright,” Lydia smiles, “since Nagisa is obaa-chan.”<br />
“…Obaa-chan?” <em>blink, blink</em>, Prico blinked. “…Hina-tan’s co-worker, aren’t she? That is what Apricot heard from Hina-tan?”<br />
“Commonplace humans are grow old,” remarked Yuuyami. “Hinagiku-san and Lydia are exceptional. You understand?”</p>

<p>Even upon Yuuyami’s observation, Prico displays a puzzled presence.</p>

<p>“Prico-chan, you don’t understand that humans are getting older, <em>desu—</em>. I’ll explain you while  showing a pictures practically, <em>desu</em>.”</p>

<p>Haruka takes Prico by a hand, helping her to stand up. Whereupon, led Prico towards the library computers.</p>

<p>“Say, Yuuyami.”</p>

<p>Lydia, who had been left behind, turned to a similarly standing there Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami also sent a sight to Lydia.</p>

<p>“Prico is, well, she is conscious, isn’t she?”<br />
“I don’t know. She appears to be emotional, she, however, might bear a program for this.”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“Checkmate.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku moved her piece, dispassionately.</p>

<p>“…As ever.”</p>

<p>Nagisa smiled, bitterly.</p>

<p>“I play chess with Apricot occasionally. So I haven’t lost my touch.”<br />
“That’s not what I’m saying, I’m not going easy on you, not what-so-ever.”</p>

<p><em>Dear me!</em> Nagisa shook her head.<br />
This is the living room of Nagisa’s house, Hinagiku and Nagisa are assumed upon chairs, facing each other across the table.<br />
Upon a table were whisky, which  Hinagiku had brought, and chess board.</p>

<p>“I’m not good at entertaining.”<br />
“I know. So you shut yourself  in the Underground, right?” smiles Nagisa. “Moreover, Hinagiku, you was arrogant enough to consider yourself a God.”<br />
“Aha. I know. I’m sorry, Nagisa.”<br />
“What for?”</p>

<p>Nagisa tilts her head a little.</p>

<p>“I’ve driven you out. I regret it.”<br />
“Ah–..,” Nagisa nods. “That’s about a data of Michael’s prediction ability, huh?”<br />
“Yes. You said, Michael’s abilities are deviate from  norms.”<br />
“Yea. If we can’t control her, the world will be ruined, huh? So, I told you that we should freeze Michael.”<br />
“I believed I could control her, thence, felt like you betrayed.”<br />
“Is that right? I’m sorry, Hinagiku. I didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p>Nagisa chuckled, a little sadly.</p>

<p>“It’s okay. I was the one who feel sorry. At that time, research was my everything.”<br />
“I know that, too. You loved research more than me, I hated that either a little.”</p>

<p>Nagisa shrugs her shoulders, smiling a little.</p>

<p>“If I cherished you more, things might have been different.”</p>

<p>In sense of life. Or, possibly, in sense of a fate of this world.<br />
However.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless Hinagiku was the one to create Michael, I believe. Moreover, if Hinagiku didn’t produce Michael, human race  wouldn’t have evolved, huh?”</p>

<p>That’s how it is.<br />
No matter where, what, and how she was acting, the butterfly effect bound to arise, even if the world is destroyed, Hinagiku of that time would have certainly created Michael. Definitely.</p>

<p>“I see, you know about humanity, about this planet…”</p>

<p>This was slightly unexpected for Hinagiku.</p>

<p>“Yea. Lydia and Yuuyami informed me everything without hiding. So, we—every a dweller of this town—were saved.”<br />
“Saved?”<br />
“You know what I mean, huh? ‘We, humans, are going to die out before long, to be erased from this universe,’ was what we thought.”<br />
“No one will remember, not a vestige, not a trace will be left behind.”</p>

<p>That would be sad, indeed, thought Hinagiku.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m saying. Nevertheless, Lydia truly had grown a good girl, huh–. And yet, at Lucy’s days she felt more, a bit colder, huh?”<br />
“Aah. She has a good personality, but her looks is exceptionally  good. She looks just like you in a childhood, sometimes I feel like assaulting her.”<br />
“As ever, huh–. You loved Lucy, right–, Hinagiku.”</p>

<p>That’s true, I guess, thought Hinagiku.<br />
Since they availed their own DNA for Angels, for Lucy’s very figure model they utilised Nagisa of childhood. I cannot but love her.<br />
Accordingly, Lucy—Lydia is undoubtedly the daughter of Hinagiku and Nagisa.</p>

<p>“With that being said, can we return to previous talk?”<br />
“Sure.”</p>

<p>I have to fulfil my objective. Objective of coming here.<br />
In other words,</p>

<p>“Can you forgive me?”<br />
“I forgive you, and you, Hinagiku, would you also forgive me, right?”</p>

<p>These are the words that I wanted.<br />
The words of forgiveness.</p>

<p>“Certainly; we both were young.”<br />
“Right, huh–. Were young, huh–. Hinagiku is still young, though.”<br />
“…If you so envious, why did you reject the drug that stops growth?”<br />
“I wanted to grow old. If possible, together with Hinagiku, you know.”<br />
“Aah, such a life might also not been bad.”<br />
“Isn’t it?” Nagisa chuckled. “More than that, you fancy to drink a whisky now? That’s it, right? That’s what we often drank together, huh? I like it, a lot.”<br />
“Aha. Let’s drink.”</p>

<p>When Hinagiku said so, Nagisa stood up and walked off.<br />
After a moment of awaiting, Nagisa returned with two glasses of ice.<br />
Hinagiku pour whisky into those glasses.</p>

<p>“What will our toast be today?” asked Nagisa.<br />
“Will you be my friend from now on?”<br />
“Certainly I will. But, no more chess, okay?”<br />
“All right,” Hinagiku lifts the glass up. “For our reunion——”<br />
“——and future friendship.”</p>

<p>They clinked their glasses,<br />
causing an echo of a pleasant sound.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Upon Hinagiku put in an appearance in the library to pick Prico up, what she found was that there was no Prico for some reason.</p>

<p>“Well, and that’s why Prico ran away.”</p>

<p><em>Ehehe</em>, Lydia scratched her head.</p>

<p>“…Sorry Lydia, could you explain it again.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku could not quite understand what Lydia was saying.<br />
No, I understand, but cannot accept—this should be more truthful.</p>

<p>“Um, like I said, it seems Prico thought that she is thrown away after you became <em>intime</em> with Nagisa, Hinagiku.”</p>

<p>Seated in a chair inside the library break space, Lydia shrugged her shoulders slightly.<br />
Apropos, sitting next to Lydia, Yuuyami assumed so proper a posture as similar to a statue.</p>

<p>“I, had thrown Apricot away…”</p>

<p>Sitting opposite, Hinagiku inclined her head upon a right hand.<br />
Prico bore no sign of that, at the time when we parted before Nagisa’s house. She was a usual, bright Prico.<br />
Or, did I overlook it?</p>

<p>“Well, after that, although I explained that Nagisa is obaa-chan, Prico couldn’t understand,” says Lydia. “That’s why Haru-chan taught her  the ageing process​ of humans, however Prico wasn’t consent, saying ‘Hina-tan should be able to, she has a wide scope!’”<br />
“…No-no-no,” Hinagiku shook her head, “I like young girls. It’s the other way around. If it’s Yugi-yugi, she <em>is</em> in a scope, however I have no intention of sleeping with present Nagisa.”<br />
“Yugg-chan is in the scope,” Yuuyami, who had been attentively​ observing the situation, unseals her lips. “Hinagiku-san is a beast or something?”<br />
“No? I just like pretty girls, okay?”</p>

<p>Stated Hinagiku, gravely.</p>

<p>“I, I see…” Yuuyami forced a smile. “Well, if you perform anything towards Yugg-chan, I should get angry.”<br />
“Don’t worry. I will do nothing. More than that, do you have any ideas where Apricot is now?”<br />
“I guess she, Haru-chan, and Noah are roaming together.”<br />
“Together with Haruka?”<br />
“Uh-huh. It would be peril to leave Prico alone, so she accompanied her.”</p>

<p>I see, Hinagiku nodded.<br />
That is why Lydia and Yuuyami are so composed. If together with Haruka, there is no risk to Prico. Both self-mutilation and self-destruction will definitely be prevented if it’s Haruka.<br />
Well, although Prico has yet no emotions nor awareness  to hurt herself, thought Hinagiku.</p>

<p>“And, where are the three of them now?”</p>

<p>For a moment, Hinagiku questioned if it should be okay to count Noah, the motorcycle.<br />
But, for it was by no means important, she decided to forget about that.</p>

<p>“Here you go.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami passed the tablet to Hinagiku.<br />
There was a real-time video, streaming from the satellite.</p>

<p>“…Aren’t they ordinarily returned to the Woodland?”</p>

<p>On midst a screen, Prico, Noah, and Haruka were discussing something before the Woodland.<br />
In a moment when Hinagiku was watching their movements, Prico entered the Woodland alone.<br />
Noah and Haruka appeared to await on the place.</p>

<p>“…I don’t know what’s going on, at any rate I will also return back to Woodland.”</p>

<p>As Hinagiku sprang up, Lydia and Yuuyami—together—slightly waved their hands.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“Prico-chan is going to become an Apricot of the Woodland, <em>desu</em>.”</p>

<p>About the Woodland, Haruka declared something ambiguous.</p>

<p>“Ahh, um. What was that?”</p>

<p>Hinagiku tilted a head, appearing fail to understand it well.</p>

<p>“We have no idea. Well, I don’t think it’s risky, aye,” says Noah. “Prico’s self-defence subroutine was normal, there weren’t seen no bugs. Neither by Haru-chan’s sensor nor by a sensor of mine.”<br />
“I see. Thanks for the help, Noah,” <em>tap-tap</em>, Hinagiku patted Noah’s seat. “Now, then, let us gather  Apricot up?”</p>

<p>Upon raising her right hand, Hinagiku, then, stepped forth into the Woodland.</p>

<p>“Do you know her location?”<br />
“Ahh. I have an idea. It’s been a long time. You can go back, Haru-chan. Thank you.”</p>

<p>Upon an answer to Haruka’s question, Hinagiku enters the Woodland, leaving a large motorcycle behind on a place, and strolling off indifferently.<br />
The Woodland being as though a courtyard​ for Hinagiku. She will not get lost even in the night.<br />
At a point of four hundred meters from the Woodland’s edge, Hinagiku spotted Prico.<br />
Prico was sitting leaned against a tree. Her head dropped down as though she was dead, and, having her arms dangling, she did not even seem to note Hinagiku who had drawn near.</p>

<p>“I knew <strong>this</strong> was the place.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku bring her hips down next to Prico, drew a cigarette from her pocket and bring it to her lips.</p>

<p>“Back in the day, I unplugged your Power Cell right <strong>here</strong>.”</p>

<p>Upon feeling of emptiness of a false love, I cast Prico away.<br />
Hinagiku considered to light a cigarette, however, glancing over the environs, she replaced a cigarette back into her pocket.<br />
Even if odds are thousand to one, she should be in a great troubles if the Woodland will  set on fire.</p>

<p>“That experience, I regret it,” Hinagiku rested her hand upon Prico’s head. “Look, Apricot, I’ll never do that again. I can vow. To a God, to the Creator, to anyone.”<br />
“Creators are Lydia and Yuuyami.”</p>

<p>Tossed Prico.</p>

<p>“Aah, yes, right.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku giggled lightly, stroking Prico’s head.</p>

<p>“Hina-tan, Apricot is, awfully sad.”</p>

<p>Prico raised her face.<br />
Hinagiku grew dazed to catch a sight of the countenance which inspired an impression​ akin that of her being on a verge of tears.</p>

<p>“What’s so sad?”<br />
“<strong>Here</strong>, the happening when Apricot was  unplugged of a Power Cell. In spite of Apricot didn’t feel anything at that time, Apricot is awfully sad presently. Why?”<br />
“Aah–, that is, I guess,”—Hinagiku moved her hand from Prico’s head to her shoulder—”your emotions…  basically, your consciousness had began to sprout.”<br />
“Consciousness?”<br />
“Aha. Right.”</p>

<p>Hinagiku passed her arm round Prico’s shoulders.<br />
Prico revealed no resist, and pressed her cheek upon a shoulder of Hinagiku.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami and Haruka said that upon one day they abruptly acquired consciousness, however is it possible to say that there were  no omens absolutely?”<br />
“…Apricot is, not really sure.”<br />
“It’s okay,” Hinagiku kisses Prico in hair. “There’s nothing wrong with it. I won’t desert you. Never again. Also, I won’t sleep with Nagisa.”<br />
“Truly?”<br />
“Aha. That’s truth.”</p>

<p>This was a place where the former Prico would smile, saying, “This is a multi-person’s play of our dream~!” However, with a shred of consciousness, Prico has no desire of Hinagiku to be taken by anyone else.<br />
Hinagiku grew exceedingly happy, upon realising it.</p>

<p>“Apricot, wants to stay with Hina-tan for ever.”<br />
“I also want it. Next time I go to see Nagisa, I’ll take you with me, Apricot. I need to introduce you as my partner.”</p>

<p>Nagisa will certainly be surprised.<br />
Perhaps Prico will  likewise be.<br />
As for the reason, that since the model of appearance of Prico is also Nagisa. However, Hinagiku decided  not to bring it up now.</p>

<p>“What is it? Apricot don’t really understand, in spite of Apricot has no heart, it feels weird,  it trills somehow, it pleasantly warm. But, why, Apricot don’t mind it by no means? Has Apricot, broke somewhere?”<br />
“No,” Hinagiku strengthened the grip upon Prico’s shoulder, “it’s a normal reaction. Nothing wrong with that. There is nothing to worry about. Besides, even if something breaks, I’ll fix it  at once. I can do anything. My speciality is a genetic engineering, however robotics is also my strong a point.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Since Hina-tan is genius, it’s safe for Apricot to break.”<br />
“Aha. But please, if possible, don’t break. For if you, Apricot, would break, it  will be sad for me.”<br />
“In this case, if that may turn Hina-tan  sad, Apricot won’t break.”<br />
“You are really a good girl, Apricot,” Hinagiku smiles. “Now, let’s return back home.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Though, Hina-tan, Apricot wants to stay like this a little longer. No good?”<br />
“No, no problem. It’s comfortable here. I like the Woodland. This moderately dim atmosphere in particular.”<br />
“Apricot likes it too—. Apricot likes everything  Hina-tan  likes.”</p>

<p>Said Prico, in a bright voice.<br />
None the less,</p>

<p>“The Apricot is who I like the  most.”<br />
“Well, Apricot likes Apricot too—.”</p>

<p>The bright Prico, is so much prettier–, Hinagiku thought to herself.<br />
And then,<br />
if only this hour could  last for ever.<br />
I could not help but desire so.</p>
