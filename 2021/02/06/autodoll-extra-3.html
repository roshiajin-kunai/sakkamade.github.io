<div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <p>The day as Lydia has been yet “the girl,” and Yuuyami “the lady.”</p>

<p>“And such is the outline of World War IV,” said lady, indifferently. “Do you have any questions?”</p>

<p>Lady was tutoring the girl the history of this planet.<br />
Honestly speaking, lady doesn’t know whether history knowledge is necessary under this perished world. However, there should be no harm in learning it.<br />
Furthermore, it is necessary to bring the girl’s level of knowledge to that of an average human being.</p>

<p>“What does it mean to fight on a robot?”</p>

<p>Said the girl, tilting a head, with an unsure appearance.<br />
The main weapon used in World War IV was a generic humanoid robot, which referred as Masquerade.</p>

<p>“Indeed. It’s a good question. In those days humans were piloting robots to handle all forms of tasks. Such is for quantum brain weren’t hitherto common and robots could not operate stand-alone.”<br />
“In other words, robots weren’t smart?”<br />
“Indeed; simply put. Thence, at the time, they were named a Masquerade​ rather than Autodoll.”<br />
“Autodoll are expensive robots such as yourself, which have quantum brains, are smart, and can do anything on their own, right?”<br />
“Yes. That is correct. Incidentally, Masquerade​ is larger by far than myself. Such is reasonable, for human may board it.”<br />
“I want to drive one.”</p>

<p><em>Hehehe</em>, giggled girl.<br />
Her smiling face was adorable, and lady also returned her a smile.</p>

<p>“Why not, indeed. Let us re-create the Masquerade​ at first opportunity.”</p>

<p>It is, however, a little arduous to reproduce one against a current equipment—simple Parts Maker.<br />
The metal physique of lady is certainly not frail, as well as she does not experience a fatigue. The time is the problem.<br />
Installation of solar panels has theretofore not been completed.<br />
And withal, even if they create Masquerade, they will have nowhere to store it.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Let’s make one for your too and drive together?”<br />
“Am I also will drive it?”<br />
“Yes. Together.”<br />
“Hm–.”</p>

<p>Lady pondered it over for a moment.<br />
However she cannot observe a significance of boarding a robot which is inferior to herself.</p>

<p>“I will rather not.”<br />
“…I see. It’s a pity.”</p>

<p>Girl sunk her face down.<br />
The girl is less willing to persist with her opinion. Was she refraining for she is not full-fledged individual yet, wondered lady.<br />
If the girl insisted, lady would have  nod ultimately.</p>

<p>“Now, we shall resume studying.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Somehow, World War IV feels awfully strange, nature is very distinct from previous World Wars.”<br />
“Quite so. This war has drastically  shifted the history of this planet, therefore I would say that it is definitely distinct.”<br />
“Not only that, I feel like connected to Lucca・Bernhardt.”</p>

<p>It was a pair of young girls to induce the World War IV.<br />
Lieselotte・Falkenmeier and Lucca・Bernhardt.</p>

<p>“Hmm–. That’s certainly strange a feeling.”</p>

<p>Lady did not believe the girl’s statement, however she also did not deny it.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. So it’s somewhat more fun to learn than usually.”<br />
“What a good thing, isn’t it.”</p>

<p>Lady smiled, and operated her tablet to display the following entry.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>The present.<br />
Approximately two months upon Yggdrasil gained consciousness. The time when autumn appear to finally arrive.</p>

<p>“Hey, Yuuyami, let’s create Masquerade.”<br />
“Rather abrupt.”</p>

<p>We were flirting on a sofa in the library, and Lydia said it as though something flashed through her mind.<br />
Apropos, Yuuyami seats upon the sofa, whereas Lydia seated upon Yuuyami’s thighs, facing her.</p>

<p>“I suddenly recalled. Come to think of it, I wanted to drive a Masquerade  when I still didn’t have a name–.”<br />
“Yes. It is remains in my log so far likewise.”<br />
“Uh-huh. So, let’s create a one for you too, Yuuyami, and have a drive together?”<br />
“I, the Autodoll, should board a robot which has a lower performance than myself?”<br />
“…Will you, hate it?”</p>

<p>Lydia’s eyes moistened, as she peered at  Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“…No, I do not particularly, dislike it…”<br />
“Then, will you drive it?”<br />
“…Er, all… right–…”<br />
“If you will play with Masquerade, you may lick my body, but only once, whenever you want, wherever you want, how about it?”<br />
“I must drive it.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami nodded wearing an extreme smile.<br />
To lick Lydia is the hobby of Yuuyami. Ever since embedding a taste sensor, she has been licking Lydia every day without omission.</p>

<p>“Do I taste that good?”<br />
“Yes. A dreamily delicious. If I don’t lick you, I will grew deficient  of Lydia’s element—briefly, Lydi-ment.”</p>

<p>Upon such statement, Yuuyami traced her tongue over Lydia’s cheek.</p>

<p>“I’ll also replenish Yuuyami’s element.”</p>

<p>Lydia  kissed  Yuuyami in a cheek lightly.</p>

<p>“Lydia!” Yuuyami tightly hugged Lydia, “I love you so unparalleledly!”<br />
“I haven’t heard that in a long time!”<br />
“Yes, I didn’t say it in a long time! I could not seize the brimming Lydi-ai, and it just flew out of my mouth!”<br />
“I don’t blame you! But quit it! Let’s determine the specifications of Masquerade​ first?”<br />
“In, indeed…”</p>

<p>Yuuyami was so saddened that relaxed her strength of hugging Lydia. Without skipping a chance, <em>schlip</em>, Lydia slips away from Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“As expected, seventh <em>dan</em> of <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em>… You might escape upon mere slight negligence…”<br />
“Fufufu,” laughs Lydia. “Come to think of it, Kizumari fought in the Masquerade​ in person, haven’t they.”</p>

<p>That’s ridiculous, thought Yuuyami at Lydia’s words.<br />
Only for a moment, however.<br />
For those two, such might not be improbable, considered Yuuyami, forcing a smile.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>In a meanwhile, about that time, Shii drove Noah heading for the capital of Sacred Lahr Empire.<br />
Sacred Lahr Empire—the country where Lieselotte・Falkenmeier reigned as the emperor’s surrogate, and led the hegemony  together with Lucca・Bernhardt.<br />
Certainly, the empire itself has been destroyed. However,  images from satellite revealed that the museum remained so far, thus Shii set out on investigation.<br />
Shii crossed the sea with Noah having installed retro-fitted anti-gravity Angie and Thruster apparatus.<br />
Both of which, by the way, are off-line, and now they run on regular tires.</p>

<p>“There is nothing around here, huh—.”<br />
“Yeah. There is not response in my sensor too.”</p>

<p>Shii said in a vague tones, Noah responded as usual.</p>

<p>“I’m looking forward to museum.”<br />
“Aha, me too. I hope there will be a bike like me.”<br />
“Um—. I rather  want to see the first quantum brain equipped on robot, the Phantom—.”<br />
“Oh—, called semi-Autodoll, right?”<br />
“Right, right.”</p>

<p>The Phantom is not perfectly autonomous, as its quantum brain is for mere assisting the human who pilots it.</p>

<p>“Lucca・Bernhardt was using it, if I remember rightly​?”<br />
“Right, right. It took a leading part of World War IV. Well, in the case of Lucca, only after she took her real name—Lucereine.”</p>

<p>Shii though as she said that:<br />
What should my name be?<br />
The name “Shii” is but a tentative name, I would like to change it to proper noun someday.<br />
As such, I’ve bear it in my mind for a long time, however cannot come up with a name that will fit me perfectly.</p>

<p>“Noah, can I change the subject?”<br />
“Aha, I’m not really a Lucca’s  fan, so it’s fine.”<br />
“I’m thinking of choosing my gender a girl.”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Shii has no gender, too, let alone a name. Hence, Shii’s body up to present under  a smooth condition, and does not furnished with organs which divide sexes.</p>

<p>“Why not–? I’ll prefer a girl on board too.”<br />
“But I rather can’t come up with the name.”<br />
“A name–? I’ve been Noah onset.”<br />
“I still don’t know who I am—. Perhaps that’s why it doesn’t come to my mind–.”<br />
“Ha?”<br />
“I’ve been thinking a lot lately. Why was I born, why am I living?”<br />
“I don’t know. I was born a bike and just live as a bike.”<br />
“I think so. It was like that with me when I was not conscious.”</p>

<p>Created as a child of Lydia and Yuuyami, behaved as one, and operated as one.<br />
I didn’t need to think of anything, my heart wasn’t affected by anything, I was just living a  life without a care in the world.</p>

<p>“Is it a kind of thought peculiar to  intelligent life-forms?”<br />
“Right, right. I’m kind of depressed, because I can’t understand my reason for existence.”<br />
“He—. Intelligent life is difficult.”<br />
“Both mama-Lydi and mama-Yuu are live as Creators, and, although they usually seem to be just flirting, they engage a things that look like that, but I don’t have anything of the sort…”</p>

<p>Lydia and Yuuyami are gradually gather remaining human beings to create a city which centred upon the library. A beautiful city where everyone can live happily.<br />
Shii esteemed them, simultaneously growing anxious  over her empty self.<br />
Even my little sister, Yggdrasil,  set her heart on becoming a next Creator.<br />
Shii has no purpose, no goal, and no idea what she wants to do.<br />
Nevertheless, inasmuch as Lydia and Yuuyami have made city development the current chief project, they  simply explore the world instead.</p>

<p>“What does that mean?”<br />
“Significance of existence..?”<br />
“Is it bad to just exist?”</p>

<p>Said just existing Noah, quite indifferently.<br />
It was kind of funny and Shii tittered.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that either—. It’s may be okay. But, I am anxious, <em>desu</em>.”<br />
“So it’s hard after all. But, shouldn’t you talk it over with Lydiyami-san—?”<br />
“It’s, somehow, difficult to ask—.”</p>

<p>They will surely listen to me, and will surely give me a right answer.<br />
However, for some reason, I cannot bring myself to it.</p>

<p>“Hmm. Well, it’s a problem I have no clue about, but I’m always willing listen.”<br />
“Thank you kindly.”</p>

<p>Shii gently patted Noah’s tank.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“Uwa–, this AR interface is amazing!”</p>

<p>Lydia said at a low altitude of two hundred meters.<br />
Lydia is currently seated in the cockpit of re-created Masquerade.<br />
The cockpit furnished with augmented reality in each and every direction. In other words, various information indicators are floating in the view outside.<br />
Consequently, Lydia feels as though soaring high in the sky with nothing but her seat alone.</p>

<p>“Indeed. If you fall off a seat, you might wrongly guess you’re going to hit the ground.”</p>

<p>Projected by AR interface, Yuuyami said so indifferently.<br />
Apropos, Yuuyami have also embarked a distinct Masquerade. The pair conversing by video transmission.<br />
Lydia’s Masquerade​ is pure white with a lily emblem upon both of shoulders. This fuselage was used by Lieselotte・Falkenmeier at the beginning of World War IV, and its name is Weiss Lily.<br />
Masquerade​ of Yuuyami is jet black, and fuselage named a Phantom. Equipped with the first quantum brain of humankind, it has a function to assist the pilot in fight. This is the one which Lucca・Bernhardt was piloting.<br />
Of course, both an aircraft had undergone dramatic performance improvements  form those days. That is for Lydia and Yuuyami performed revision of specifications to reflect current engineering​ level, and only thereupon re-created it.</p>

<p>“Ah, citizens of Lydiami・City starring at us quite hard,” happily says Lydia, turning  external speakers on. “Oi—, this is us–.”</p>

<p>Lydia vigorously waved Weiss Lily’s right hand.<br />
Hearing a voice of Lydia, citizens broadly smiled, “Ah, what’s up with these Creators  again,” and returned to their daily lives.</p>

<p>“Now, Lydia, what are we going to do on these Masquerades​?”<br />
“Battle!”<br />
“Battle!?”</p>

<p>Cried Yuuyami, appearing to be surprised.</p>

<p>“It’s a jest. Armament is dummy, right?”</p>

<p>Both Weiss Lily and Phantom equipped  with weapons, however they are only a dummy.</p>

<p>“That surprised me,” <em>whew</em>, Yuuyami grew a sigh of relief. “However, upon a World War IV days, therein were frequent to take a place an actual battles  of Masquerades.”<br />
“Uh-huh. I can’t understand how they could kill each other through such lovely interface, but it was unavoidable in the world at that time, right?”<br />
“Yes; for dissatisfaction were yet filling the world of those days.”<br />
“A few people monopolised wealth, a poor people remained poor, discrimination, envy, anger, despair—awfully sad society.”<br />
“Yes. The girls waged war to reshape this world.”<br />
“And they loved each other. Just like us.”<br />
“Indeed. Even in such a world were dwelling a love.”<br />
“The world cannot be without a love, Yuuyami.”<br />
“I believe so likewise.”<br />
“Say, Yuuyami, since we already at it, why don’t we fly over to Shii-chan by Masquerade​ as is?”<br />
“To location of Shii-chan?” Yuuyami lightly tilted her head to the side. “Hmm-. For we don’t have any urgent business, all right. Most likely now she touring the museum of Sacred Lahr Empire.”<br />
“I’m sure Shii-chan will be surprised.”</p>

<p>Said  Lydia, with a great joy.</p>

<p>“I guess. Or rather, I’m a little worried of Shii-chan…”<br />
“Um. What is it?”<br />
“Recently,  she somehow appears to be quite depressed.”<br />
“Uh-huh. So I asked her to head to museum for change of pace, though?”<br />
“Eh? Was that so?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami opened her eyes.</p>

<p>“Ha? Didn’t I tell you?”<br />
“You did not. Lydia, you pretty often feel like explained afore, aren’t you?”<br />
“Ahaha–, sorry.”</p>

<p>Lydia apologised, whereas scratching a cheeks.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all right. Why do you think Shii-chan is depressed?”<br />
“I have no idea, though? I wonder why. She didn’t tell me, so I don’t know.”<br />
“That’s somewhat, well, indeed. Would you like to ask her upon a meeting?”<br />
“Nuh-uh,” Lydia shakes her head; “we should wait until she ask us herself. Shii-chan is full-fledged intelligent life-form, she can figure it out on her own.”<br />
“Hopefully it will be so…”<br />
“You may be a little overprotective, Yuuyami, aren’t you?”<br />
“You also overprotective, Lydia, I presume? For you hid that…”<br />
“And you agreed with that, aren’t you, Yuuyami?”<br />
“…Yes, right, for… I love Shii-chan.”<br />
“So do I,” Lydia shrugs. “Now, Yuuyami, let us surprise our beloved child.”</p>

<p>Pointing Weiss Lily towards a Sacred Lahr Empire, Lydia accelerates.<br />
The Phantom of Yuuyami followed her thither likewise.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Shii activated a private power generation system of  museum.<br />
Well, there being dark is not an issue for Shii’s visual sensor, however it’s nice when well-lit in terms of mood.<br />
I don’t mind the ruinous ambience, but I prefer visit such places in a bright and enjoyable fashion still.</p>

<p>“No intelligent life, no Autodoll, huh—.”<br />
“Right. I can’t  detect it  even with my sensor, <em>desu—</em>.”</p>

<p>Noah is also entered the museum with Shii.<br />
Vehicles are normally off-limits, however no one will blame for it at present.<br />
They took their time leisurely viewing the exhibits inside.<br />
As the air conditioning of the building being not effective, the air was a little impure. Albeit, for they had no need in respiration, it is not a problem.</p>

<p>“Oh, there it is. Phantom’s quantum brain.”</p>

<p>Murmured Shii, observing a transparent case with the quantum brain placed within upon a pedestal.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it’s not really working?”</p>

<p>Noah said plainly.</p>

<p>“Of course. It has a much shorter service life​ than us in the first place. Quantum brain won’t start-up.”</p>

<p>Shii can operate for a thousand years in case of maintenance is duly done. And if the technology will develop further in the future, she also may possibly operate for a longer timespan.<br />
Well, the question is, what in the world to do throughout such long live.<br />
And yet for both Lydia and Yuuyami a thousand a years are brief, they said they wish to live much, much longer. I believe that’s for they hold a solid personalities, and discovered the purpose and significance of living.</p>

<p>“Ah. But the storage isn’t decay. Its condition is good, aye? As long as we send a power, we can read log with Lightning Blade, right?”</p>

<p>Lightning Blade, name of the fastest existing wired interface.</p>

<p>“Noah, Phantom predates Lightning Blade—.”<br />
“Oh–, I see, we need a converter cable?”<br />
“Well, I brought it.”</p>

<p><em>Fufu</em>, laughed Shii, taking the backpack down.<br />
Then, upon rummaging within, she takes out a Lightning Blade with transducer and old-generation cables for Phantom, two sets apiece.</p>

<p>“I remove the case first.”</p>

<p>Shii operated a control panel, which were installed on the right front of the case, stowing it away​ in the floor.<br />
Then, she inserts a Lightning Blade into her right wrist and connects it to transducer. Thereupon, she also inserts cable from transducer into the Phantom’s quantum brain.<br />
She, then, in order to send the energy from Noah’s Power Cell, plug a Lightning Blade into Noah’s port, connects it to transducer, and quantum brain of the Phantom.<br />
Noah immediately started to deliver the energy, however quantum brain itself was still not operational. But that is not a problem. Energy is being sent to storage, and it will startup in due course.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let’s read the records of Phantom.”</p>

<p>From the beginning, Shii intended to do just that. She wondered if she could procure something  upon reviewing the logs of Phantom, that took a leading part of World War IV.<br />
What have the girls thought, why did they fought, what kind of conversations they exchanged, and how did they conquer the hegemony of world unification?<br />
The idea of conquering the world of that time would not have been possible without very strong a desire.<br />
A strong desire that Shii doesn’t bear. The purpose of living that Shii cannot discover. She wanted to cognise​ each of them.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>The girls fought, whereas wounded.<br />
The girls fought whereas wounding.<br />
Whereas being called Diabolus, and yet running towards the ideal world.<br />
Facing a harsh reality, crying over and over again, and yet looking at the future.<br />
Hated, cursed by many, and yet dreaming of the world  of a new shape.<br />
The girls acted as evil, yet  evil they were never.<br />
Phantom and Weiss Lily.<br />
Illusion​ and  <em><ruby>Shirayuri<rt> White Lily </rt></ruby></em>.<br />
The war chronicle was as shocking so to turn Shii’s view warped.<br />
Upon reading the records of the girls’ battles entirely, upon that moment, my view grew distorted, blurred, nigh causing me to panic.</p>

<p>“What is this!?”</p>

<p>Rubbing the visual sensor, I understood the source of a view distortion—liquid.</p>

<p>“…Tears?”</p>

<p>Shii whispered, seeing the moisture upon her palm.</p>

<p>“I can, cry..?”</p>

<p>I didn’t know. I had such a function? Shii didn’t know. I have never cried before.</p>

<p>“Are you okay, Shii-chan?”</p>

<p>Questioned Noah, worrying over the condition of Shii.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—… but, now, I am filled with a lots of emotions…”</p>

<p>As though being hit by emotions of the girls.<br />
Shii couldn’t make a precise judgment as of whether she was sad, happy, or angry.<br />
Right when,<br />
a certain file that stored in Shii’s storage was automatically read.<br />
Shii did not read it out of her own will. It  truly​ was automatically read.<br />
It existed as a hidden file, one which Shii herself was not aware of.</p>

<p>“Video..?”</p>

<p>The expanded file displayed Lydia and Yuuyami.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“If you watching this video, Shii-chan, that means you have already gained consciousness, and have emotions.”</p>

<p>Lydia said, friendly grinning.</p>

<p>“With that, I presume you are crying for something sorrowful​ had occurred. As you probably yet learned, you have a feature​ to shed a tears initially.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami said, indifferently.</p>

<p>“You know, Shii-chan, if one becomes conscious, there are seldom a painful moments, too? It also happened to me. Such as when Ohan slew the snake.”<br />
“Yes. It happened to me also. I may have not converse about it, however once I was nigh a break down, and sink into the darkness.”<br />
“Although I don’t know why you’re crying now, Shii-chan, but don’t worry.”<br />
“There is far more fun things in the life, isn’t it so?”<br />
“Right. And, you know, no matter what happens, no matter how sad things will get, we’ll always stand by your side, Shii-chan, aren’t we?”<br />
“Yes. The very truth. In the first place, Shii-chan, you  was born under this world as a result of my and Lydia’s mutual affection. You are a fruit of pure love. Please, do not forget that.”<br />
“You are loved, Shii-chan. Me and Yuuyami love you. And, although you are crying now, remember our love.”<br />
“And supposing you are still sad please come to us. We would give you a lots of hugs, kisses, and will stroke your head.”<br />
“Or just call us, we’ll fly over.”<br />
“We are happy for your, Shii-chan, very existence.”<br />
“Right. That’s why, no matter what happens, don’t do something like destroying or hurting yourself. We will show you a beautiful world, we will definitely protect you.”<br />
“Ah,” exclaims Yuuyami, as though recalling unexpectedly, “perhaps Shii-chan has already decided on the name?”<br />
“Ah–!” Lydia alarmed upon remembering likewise; “yes, maybe you aren’t Shii-chan any more!?”<br />
“We messed it up, aren’t we, Lydia. Would you like to reshoot?”<br />
“Eh—? We took it with such a pains, it’s fine.”<br />
“Hmm. Well, Shii-chan will be able to communicate, it may not be a great issue.”<br />
“Right, right; when we shooting this Shii-chan is still Shii-chan, and not yet conscious.”<br />
“Indeed. To conclude it, Shii-chan, don’t cry for ever, please rely upon us. Unless for rebellious phase.”<br />
“Right. You can count on us. Well, then, pass our best regards to us in years to come.”</p>

<p>Lydia and Yuuyami waved their hands, and the video concluded.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“Why can’t you be serious until the end—–!”</p>

<p>While shouting, Shii wept once again.<br />
This time for being too happy that she cried.<br />
Her chaotic emotions now vanished, and but a great affection of her mothers found a place in Shii’s heart.</p>

<p>“W, what is it, Shii-chan?”</p>

<p>Noah sounded surprised.<br />
<em>Rub, rub</em>, Shii wipes her tears.</p>

<p>“Noah, I need to return to library. I want to see my mamas right now.”<br />
“Mm? Can’t you just communicate?”<br />
“Can not. I want to meet them. I want  to meet them and hug them tightly.”</p>

<p>Shii hastily disconnects the cables, transducers, and crammed them her backpack.<br />
Thereupon, straddling Noah, she quit the museum.<br />
Right at that moment:</p>

<p>“Oi—, this is us—!”</p>

<p>A black Masquerade​ and a white Masquerade​ were rising upon the ground, waving their hands.<br />
It was a Weiss Lily and Phantom that Shii cognised in the log earlier.</p>

<p>“Mama-Lydi… and, mama-Yuu?”</p>

<p>Shii snapped her eyes open in surprise.<br />
What a coincidence. Or inevitable it is? After Shii reviewed the war chronicle of two machines—the records of two girls who fought as its pilots—she would never expect those two very machines to show up.</p>

<p>“Yes. It is me. The plan to surprise Shii-chan appears to be a success.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Shii-chan, your eyes are rounded in perfect circle, so cute!”<br />
“They truly flew to me…” Shii’s eyes fill up a tears. “I want both of you to alight!”</p>

<p>Whereas saying, Shii dismount the Noah.<br />
Lydia and Yuuyami opened the cockpit hatch and jumped  down right from there.<br />
From the height that an ordinary person might bear injures.<br />
Being that Lydia is <em>Kuga Ha Shinryu</em> seventh <em>dan</em>, however, this height does not pose any problem.<br />
As for Yuuyami, there was no problem originally.<br />
Upon confirming that the pair has landed, Shii ran and cling onto Lydia.</p>

<p>“Whoa, what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>Lydia held Shii back, and spun upon the place to suppress that thrusting  power.</p>

<p>“Me too! Me too!”</p>

<p>Yuuyami embraced Shii from behind.</p>

<p>“I wanted to meet mamas so much!”</p>

<p>Said Shii, who was comfortably interposed between her two mothers.</p>

<p>“Eh? What happened?”<br />
“I saw the video. The hidden file!”<br />
“Oh, I see.”</p>

<p>Lydia smiled tenderly, and stroked Shii’s head.<br />
Upon Lydia ceased stroking her, Yuuyami brushed a hair of Shii.<br />
Both of them have yet guessed what had happened to Shii. Well, they certainly have, for they know the conditions under which hidden file will expand.<br />
When Yuuyami finished stroking, Shii started to talk, in a smattering words:</p>

<p>“I.., I don’t know why I exist, nor can decide on name, but…”</p>

<p>Lydia and Yuuyami smiled, awaiting for following part.</p>

<p>“But now I know that my mamas love me… although I knew it from the beginning, now I reconfirmed, and, although used to refuse discussing it with mamas, I wish to now.”<br />
“Uh-huh. We listening.”<br />
“Yes; please say whatever it is.”<br />
“I, I want, my mamas to choose a name for me.”</p>

<p>Upon Shii’s statement, Lydia and Yuuyami glanced at each other and exchanged a giggles.</p>

<p>“Why are you laughing!?”<br />
“No, actually…” says Yuuyami.<br />
“Actually, there is one name we were thinking of,” stated Lydia.<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>Shii was surprised by an unexpected remark.</p>

<p>“We considered to let you, Shii-chan, to determine your own name…”<br />
“Though we enjoying deciding on names too…”<br />
“When did you think of that?”<br />
“Before you was born, Shii-chan.”<br />
“So that how it is.”</p>

<p>Shii turned silent for a moment, and then,</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”</p>

<p>puffed her cheeks out.<br />
Of course, I’m not really angry. I only enjoy the flow of conversation.<br />
I already know why they didn’t tell me it, in the first place.<br />
The pair kept it quiet so that Shii could choose whatever a name she wanted.</p>

<p>“Then, do you want to hear?”</p>

<p>Lydia smiles, mischievously.</p>

<p>“Of course I do!”</p>

<p>Shii’s heart grew full of excitement and anticipation.</p>

<p>“Haruka,” said Lydia.<br />
“After kanji for the ‘Flower that Blooms in a Sunlight’—Haruka.”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Yuuyami informed​ her the meaning.<br />
Shii repeatedly ruminates the name “Haruka” in quantum brain.<br />
Haruka. Ha-ru-ka. Haruka.<br />
Ah–, this name, it is, <br />
a gentle poetry as though.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>When Shii woke up, she was blank.<br />
She was just a puppet who behaved according to program.<br />
Eventually, Shii gained a consciousness,<br />
because of that, however,<br />
she didn’t know who she was any more.<br />
She could not find a reason for existence.<br />
And now,<br />
at last, Shii perceived who she was.<br />
Perceived why she existed as well.<br />
Shii is loved. She exists because she is loved. She was created and is alive by the pure love of Lydia and Yuuyami.<br />
It was a very happy thing, it filled her heart. So nice the answer was.<br />
Whereafter,<br />
today, Shii became Haruka.<br />
Very gentle a name, as though a bouquet of <em><ruby>White Lilies<rt> Shirayuri </rt></ruby></em>.</p>
