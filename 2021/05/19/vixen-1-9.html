    <p>Evidently, Ohana was pleased with <em>sukeroku sushi</em> from supermarket.<br />

<p>“I disdained it, but it is fairly good.”<br />
“From whose perspective is this comment? But I see you understand it now. Supermarket’s <em>bento</em> are really convenient.”<!--???--><br />
“That is true; however… is every day like this?”<br />
“Umm—, pretty much.”<br />
<!--excerpt--></p>

<p>The image of Fuyuka doing her best to cook for herself when she started living alone is nowhere to be found now. And solitary remnants left are a little dusty rice cooker and a dish dryer.</p>

<p>“Certainly, I understand this is conveniently simple. But wouldn’t your have an unbalanced nutrition by such nourishment on daily basis? And together with the life rhythm I have just heard of, this will never make your tiredness go…”</p>

<p>Fuyuka chuckles at a disquieted Ohana, “This feels more like mother than wife—.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped. That feeling of tiredness somehow makes up all the working people. I think.”</p>

<p>In point of fact, Fuyuka​ was constantly consuming herself, either in body or in mind.<br />
Even before  various mishaps ever began to occur, she was so much occupied by her work schedule that her daily life had withered away: On days off she slept and slept and slept without so much as a shred of fulfilment, she kept unbalanced diet, she was stressed out, and so on, and so on… Anyhow, her fatigue is unlikely to ever subside.<br />
Whilst immersed in her resignation, Fuyuka lets rather wicked smile to her face as she reflects upon her miserable life.</p>

<p>“So, Ohana, what will you do for this completely worthless me, I wonder? Aren’t you my wife.”<br />
“Mm-hmm—…”</p>

<p>Being enquired that, Ohana began to gravely brood over it. “First, sleeping hours, no, domestic chores, diet… However, fundamentally…”  so she started to murmur, and does not quite seem to return.<br />
Her singular tail kept swaying tranquilly from the side to the side. “Honestly, I would love  to stroke her ears and tail somehow,”  thought Fuyuka, for she is a great animal lover.</p>

<p>“Um—, sure enough the burden of housework is hea…vy. What is it?”</p>

<p>Ohana questioned quizzically, noting a look with mixture of ardent desire in the eyes of the lady. Albeit she did not appear to tread so far as to reveal Fuyuka’s thought, she only tilted her head sideways, and set afloat a question mark.</p>

<p>“No, never mind… S-so then, what is your action plan?”</p>

<p>Fuyuka hastily changes the subject to disguise the fact of her hard stare. Ohana, however, appears not to particularly mind, and replies to the question docilely.</p>

<p>“I could take care of house chores, for example daily cooking and laundry! From thinking over about what I heard earlier, it seems to me that you are so badly drained with your work that you simply left with no spirits to place into the other matters.”<br />
“It would certainly help me, but…”<br />
“Therefore, if I fill in your every-day’s housework, you shall gain some leeway, shall you not? As I am the one who have come to marry you, I shall be glad to be allowed to do at least this much.”<br />
“Ohana, I don’t really want you to serve as my housekeeper. How should I put it, I feel our ‘wife’ concepts are a little unalike—.”</p>

<p>The wife Ohana refers to is of slightly outdated outlook.<br />
Tenet, so to speak, of taking a step backwards and providing fervent assistance to the partner from the shadows is fairly different from world’s model of this day and age.<br />
Albeit Fuyuka herself, too, does not long to let Ohana bear all the housework, so that she could concentrate on her job alone. Her ideal scenario is a mutual support in such doings if possible.<br />
Ohana nodded her assent:</p>

<p>“Neither am I thinking of making a housekeeper of myself, okay? My only wish is to do what I can, and if you dissent from leaving everything up to me, why, we should divide the workload between each other?”<br />
“Mm-hmm—…”</p>

<p>This time it was Fuyuka’s turn to produce hum of agreement.<br />
The point of Ohana is not incorrect, and depending on wording, it is virtually in ideal for Fuyuka shape.</p>

<p>Ultimately, in view of a fact that she just met the girl today, and determined to admit her as the wife, even if temporary, at the moment Fuyuka settled to honour judgement of Ohana.</p>

<p>“All right… For now, I’ll only ask you to stay within a reason then.”<br />
“Yes, understood!”</p>

<p>Fuyuka breathed a sigh at joyfully replying enthusiastic Ohana, and glanced at clock in the room.</p>

<p>“Only seven—.”</p>

<p>After finishing <em>bento</em> and washing the containers, they had a moment of peace and tranquillity. Hitherto it was too early to prepare for bathing, but in spite of that, it hardly marked the absence of questions at hand.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, Ohana, haven’t you said that you are turning in at nine?”<br />
“Yes, I have. Ah, it’s all right, you need not adjust to me.”<br />
“No, well, I think it’s good to have early night once in a while. But that’s not the problem…”<br />
“Eh?”<br />
“I have only one set of futons.”</p>

<p>The remark momentarily enwrapped the room in silence.</p>

<p>“H-haah—, I see.”</p>

<p>And yet, Ohana spoke these words wearing a countenance atone to “What is she trying to say here?”</p>

<p>“‘I see?’ And how were you planning to sleep!?”<br />
“How? We shall sleep together, are we not? If so, should it not be fine to share the futon?”<br />
“Eh, eeh!? Together!?”</p>

<p>Although Ohana is <em>Youko</em>, her looks is still maiden’s. As for Fuyuka’s part, she did not set her heart on entering the bed together.<br />
As mentioned previously, Fuyuka sees the same sex as an object of romantic interest to the point of dating a girl (forlorn by her now). Of course, she likes charming ladies and pretty girls.<br />
Thence, when it comes to activity such as sleeping together with Ohana, who has ears and a tail, but can easily be called a beautiful girl, it is obscure if she has it in her to keep herself in check.</p>

<p>“W-wait. No matter how you put it, the day of our encounter is not the day… of us becoming newly-weds—— We are newly-weds!”<!--???--></p>

<p>There was consent on provisional situation, but was not a restriction on sleeping together, and Ohana intended to do so from the very beginning, in the first place. That was the reason she did not panic at all.</p>

<p>“Why, fear not! I have diligently, sufficiently practised. And pray entrust me with your bathing as well!”<br />
“Practised!? Practised what exactly!? What you’ve been doing!? Or wait, taking bath  together, too!? No—impossible—no!! It’s small, it’s just <em>too</em> small—!”</p>

<p>The evening passes noisily.</p>

<p>Economic flats do have quite confined bathrooms, furthermore have installed unit-baths.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> If two people were to sit in one together, ending up in some sort of cuddling is inevitable. As one would expect, Fuyuka had to prevent them from bathing together, because doing this nude truly unfolds rich a variety of risks.</p>

<p>“Not too cramped?”<br />
“No, it’s all right. <em>All right…</em>”</p>

<p>However, in return, they shared the bed. Or rather, there was only one futon set, and Fuyuka could do nothing against Ohana’s saying, “If we cannot sleep together, why, the floor shall be my bed.”<br />
Despite the slightly induced situation, letting the girl who came with the plan of becoming her wife to sleep directly upon wooden flooring would be too heartless of Fuyuka.<br />
Through this and that, they ended up together under the same blanket now.</p>

<p>“Fwa-ah—…”</p>

<p>Ohana is petite. Leaving out of consideration the height of her ears, she is likely about the height of a middle school pupil.<br />
As a matter of habit, she immediately began to nod little past nine, and naturally nestling up to Fuyuka’s side, she closed her eyes shut.</p>

<p>(Stay calm; stay calm; stay calm——)</p>

<p>Setting aside her looks of a middle school pupil, she was a beautiful girl. Adding up to it her oh so unduly defenceless state, and Fuyuka had to desperately withstand the urge to reach out for her. Her voluminous tail and occasionally twitching ears were terribly attractive.<br />
Fuyuka, whose desire was about to leak out due to alien to her warmth of the body by the side, frantically shut the eyes tight, forcing her consciousness away.</p>

<p>(Evil spirits, dissipate; evil spirits, dissipate; evil spirits, dissipate‍—‍—‍)</p>

<p>A struggle between Fuyuka and the demons within her lasted throughout the night, as she kept chanting an unintelligible words over and over again.</p>
