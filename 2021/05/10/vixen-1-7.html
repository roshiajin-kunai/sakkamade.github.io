    <p>Thus, past this and that, a mysterious act in the life of Fuyuka and Ohana have had its opening.<br />
Today is Saturday, time is almost five in the afternoon. Before long, an average household will commence preparations for dinner.</p>

<p>It is no exception to Ohana.</p>

<p>“So then, I shall cook the dinner enfolded in my love!”<br />
<!--excerpt--></p>

<p>Her ears are <em>byoko-byoko</em>,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> her tail is <em>bun-bun</em>,<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> when Fuyuka blends in a sigh of her own, and replies to full of vigour girl:</p>

<p>“… I’m sorry, but I don’t have any groceries.”<br />
“Huh?”</p>

<p>Being allowed to open the fridge, “So this is the fridge? This one is so much smaller than the ice house,” Ohana murmured, throwing open the door, and snapping her eyes wide.</p>

<p>“Um—…”</p>

<p>All its content comprised but plastic bottles of tea and water, several eggs, Vienna sausages of economical size, and some seasoning like soy sauce.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Hiiragi-sama, what​ your diet usually is…?”<br />
“Lots of <em>bento</em>, I guess. I buy them at supermarket in front of the station or at convenience store nearby.”<br />
“H-how can it be…”<!--???--></p>

<p>“There you go, you are going to be disappointed,” puffed up her chest Fuyuka. Even though this is hardly something to be proud of, so is much simpler if one lives alone. When she had just moved in, she tried her best at cooking, but the more she struggled amid the waves of society, the more away she drifted from cookery.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it harmful to your health? When I studied, I was taught that <em>bento</em> here are harmful to the health, due to chemical seasoning used for strong flavours.”<br />
“Perhaps you are right, but, well, it’s simple and convenient. Or rather, I’ve been hearing this ‘studying’ for a while now, what kind of education program was that?”<br />
“In place of my previous residence, we have a practice of taking lessons upon the world one is marrying into. Therefore, I had thoroughly covered this side of matters, as well!”</p>

<p>Fuyuka could not help feeling the information is biased and incorrect, though she made up her mind not to delve into the matter, reaching a conclusion “I will supplement it, if necessary.”</p>

<p>“If we currently have no groceries, we shall go and purchase them! I shall put my best foot forwards! Do you have any requests?”<br />
“Err—, isn’t it okay for today? Let’s start it tomorrow.”<br />
“B-but, Hiiragi-sama, when it comes to your health…”<br />
“This again, this ‘sama,’ you don’t need to use it. Somehow it makes me uneasy, I was never called that. Besides, even if provisional, shouldn’t my wife call me more intimately?”</p>

<p>Hearing these words, after pondering a little, Ohana nodded her consent.</p>

<p>“I believe you are correct. Then, what shall I call you?”<br />
“Just Fuyuka is fine. I don’t even need honorifics.”<br />
“Honorifics are mannerism of mine… Then, might I call you Fuyuka-san?”<br />
“Um—, well I guess that’s fine.”<br />
“Then, then pray call me Ohana!”<!--???--><br />
“Uh-huh, all right.”</p>

<p>Agreed Fuyuka, rising up.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s go to the supermarket.”<br />
“Yes! We shall purchase the groceries!”</p>

<p>Fuyuka, however, shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, today we will have a <em>bento</em>.”<br />
“Eh? W-why? I’m fairly confident in my cooking skills…”<br />
“Supermarket in front of the station is way better to buy groceries.”<br />
“… How is it better?”<br />
“Supermarket behind this flat<!-- maybe "block" as in tower block --> is small, has poor assortment, and prices are a little too high. Moreover, early on they started to offer discounts on <em>bento</em> and side dishes here, it’s a good deal from financial standpoint.”<br />
“H-haah—.”<br />
“Ohana, you can’t get groceries for free. If you can buy them as cheap as possible, you must do just that, would you agree?”<br />
“That is quite so. However, pray never mind the money!”</p>

<p>Declaring so, from out of nowhere Ohana drew out a tiny cloth bag, and tendered it to Fuyuka. Once she took it, it proved to be much weightier than she anticipated, and nearly dropped it.</p>

<p>“A-and this is?”<br />
“The money! I brought my savings, for it would be ill of me to lay all the expenses upon the one I marry.”</p>

<p>Peeking at its content fearfully, Fuyuka found the coins that one would definitely see in the history textbooks.</p>

<p>“… Ohana.”<br />
“Yes, what is it! Ah, Fuyuka-san, it’s all right, you may use it!”</p>

<p>Remarked Ohana, smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, this can’t be used here.”<br />
“… … Phuwheh—?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t she studied it back there,” wondered Fuyuka as her shoulders slumped slightly; Ohana stayed still in place with her lips parted, appearing to be perfectly astounded by the matter.</p>

<p>♢</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, I cannot believe that we cannot use it here.”<br />
“Well, perhaps if we take it to the pawn shop, it may cost a great sum.”</p>

<p>Fuyuka and Ohana were on their way to supermarket behind the flat.<br />
In the end, as Fuyuka shall provide the wherewithal, the pair settled on purchasing <em>bento</em> for dinner today, and groceries at the supermarket in front of the station tomorrow.</p>

<p>“Ugh—, what failure of a wife I am… to inconvenience when trying to be helpful…”<br />
“Forget about it. You just have to learn how things are here little by little. Besides, <em>bento</em> isn’t always that bad, why don’t you give it a try today, Ohana?”<br />
“… All right. Today I should prefer to experience this <em>bento</em> box which is famous for being harmful to the health and rich in chemical seasoning!”<br />
“… … By the way, what is your favourite dish, Ohana? Sure enough, something between the <em>aburaage</em><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and <em>inarizushi</em>?”<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup><br />
“Uwah, amazing! How did you guess???”<br />
“Ah, no, well, I just thought there was a chance—.”</p>

<p>This is a well-known fact that  foxes favour these meals highly, and it appears to apply to Ohana, either. “Would be nice to find <em>bento</em> with <em>inarizushi</em>.” Thinking thusly, Fuyuka and Ohana proceeded their walk.</p>

<p>“And what do <em>you</em> prefer, Fuyuka-san?”<br />
“Me? Me, eh—, I wonder—. Honestly, any <em>bento</em> is fine.”<br />
“Then, what would you fancy me to cook?”<br />
“Eh? Umm—…”</p>

<p>She has not had someone to cook for her in ages, which made it difficult to answer. Anything would be fine as long as it is prepared for her, but if she were to answer that, Ohana would more than likely be stumped by it. Hence, presently she chose to answer what she was fond of in her childhood.</p>

<p>“<em>Dashimaki tamago</em>;<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> my mother used to make it every once in a while. It was my favourite.”<br />
“I see, I see, I shall keep it in mind!”</p>

<p>She could not help a humble smile at such remark of Ohana, who threw her chest up. Supposing she prepared it, it shall certainly be a joyful event.<!--???--><br />
While chatting on like that, they arrived at supermarket. Although small, also a lively one, because numerous houses were dispersed around it, and everyone, from child to elder, living in its vicinity visits it everyday.<!--changed--></p>

<p>“Let’s enter then.”<br />
“Th-this is the supermarket. Here, one may find all the daily necessities but groceries.”<br />
“Let’s say it depends on the location too.”</p>

<p>Along with Ohana, who for some reason shivered with trepidation, Fuyuka stepped into the supermarket.</p>
