    <p>“Good morning~.”</p>

<p>Greeted everyone Fuyuka.<!-- much changed --> Having already arrived to the office, some of her co-workers returned her a faint replies. Thusly, she seated herself at the desk and turned on the computer.<br />
<!--excerpt--></p>

<p>“Good morning, Hiiragi-san—.”<br />
“Oh, morning.”</p>

<p>Motokane Kana, two years with the company, addressed Fuyuka.<br />
When she joined here, Fuyuka was assigned as her mentor and keeper, and now, two years later, they remain in the same kind of relationship.</p>

<p>“Eh? New girls aren’t here yet?”<br />
“Hmm, I thought they were supposed to be training for business etiquette elsewhere through all this week. Aren’t they should arrive only next week—?”</p>

<p>It is mid-April. It was just a few days ago that​ there was the initiation ceremony for new <em>employés</em>.</p>

<p>“I remember being at one when I just joined too, but I much wonder if it has any point.”<br />
“I don’t know—. I was all just ‘How lucky~, I don’t need to work but will still get my salary.’”<br />
“How honest of you. Well, it’s going to be hell from next week, hopefully they enjoy the moment.”<br />
“You make it sound like it’s their last supper before the campaign.”</p>

<p>“Hopefully they would not throw in a towel, and <em>will</em> actually start working at the head office from next week,” was anxious Fuyuka. She herself has grown accustomed  to this rather exploitative tendency by now.<!--???--><br />
Having her mind occupied by thinking of new <em>employés</em> undergoing their training, Kana abruptly went for distinct topic.</p>

<p>“By the way, Hiiragi-san, did something happen?”<br />
“Eh!? E-excuse me?”<br />
“I don’t know. On Mondays, you always have a look like you’re about to die any moment now, but today you look rather normal, ish.”<br />
“N-no~? Not really~?”<br />
“Secrecy is not your strong point, is it. Well, I suppose it’s much better than being in doldrums. Though, you’ve got me curious~…”</p>

<p>“U-ugh.”</p>

<p>Fuyuka found herself backing away as her junior futilely gave her a smiley​ look. Like this, then, her mind drifted back into the today’s early morning.</p>

<p>♢</p>

<p>“Good morning Fuyuka-san. It’s morning.”<br />
“Um, mhm…”</p>

<p>Fuyuka leisurely travelled her eyes ajar to as yet unaccustomed voice, and to gentle shaking, to see Ohana peer in from above.</p>

<p>“Whueh!?”</p>

<p>All of a sudden, gorgeous vixen filled Fuyuka’s sight, causing her to rapidly bring her consciousness back, and to spring up to her feet even.</p>

<p>“Oh-Oh-Ohana…!?”<br />
“Yes, it is myself… The breakfast is ready.”</p>

<p>If one were to check the clock, it is half past six now. As for usual Fuyuka, her habit is to wake at seven, then to, <em>dara-dara</em>,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> slothfully make herself ready, and be out just like that.</p>

<p>“Now pray come and wash your face. I shall arrange dishes in meanwhile.”<br />
“Ah, uh-huh…”</p>

<p>“When did she wake up?” Similar to their first night, they shared the futon last night likewise. Hence, to notice her awakening expected to be quite easy; but it may be that Fuyuka had been too deep in her sleep to notice. She, of course, went to bed just before nine o’clock, and had no usual  languid drowsiness to her now.<br />
By Ohana’s urging, Fuyuka washed her face and brushed her teeth. And by the time she returned, the breakfast was waiting laid out upon a low <em>chabudai</em>.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>“After your mentioned not to eat breakfasts usually, I made it light today.”</p>

<p>Rice with miso soup and omelette with <em>tsukemono</em><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> lay upon the table. Either of them is in rather smaller serving than in the evening, and could be eaten quickly.</p>

<p>“Ohana, what time did you get up?”<br />
“At six, I did. I spent yesterday’s evening on some little preparations, so this much went briskly! Heh-heh!”<br />
“Amazing… seriously.”</p>

<p>Even getting up earlier than usual scarcely Fuyuka had time to spare, so they were deprived of the room for chat. Fuyuka took her seat at the table, since after all Ohana’s preparing dishes for her took a great deal of effort. Ohana also similarly seated herself down, and began munching in her company.</p>

<p>“Ah, this is <em>dashimaki</em>…”</p>

<p>Once she brought omelette to her mouth, the taste of the <em>dashi</em><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> gently spread within. It was Fuyuka’s favourite flavour.</p>

<p>“Yes, I made it for it is your favourite. These supermarkets sure are wonderful, they have all sorts of flavouring for <em>dashi</em>.”<br />
“If I had to say, Ohana, you—the one who can prepare it in a twinkle—is the wonderful one.”</p>

<p>Fuyuka was positively conscious that they bought some kind of seasonings when they visited the supermarket. At the time, she merely passed it off as okay. By no means  could she expect to be buying them for <em>dashimaki</em>-business right away.</p>

<p>“Does it suit your taste? I have sampled it, and I don’t find it insipid.”<br />
“Uh-huh, it’s delicious. Just the way I like it.”<br />
“Is that right! I am so happy to hear it!”</p>

<p>Fuyuka should normally be too drowsy to have appetite in the morning, but she found herself absorbing it in no time at all, and, in fact, felt like it was a bit insufficient.</p>

<p>“… I’m off.”<br />
“Yes! Have a good day!”<br />
“Say,  yesterday we discussed the daytime and my late return, so…”<br />
“I know, I know! Pray head to work and don’t let you mind dwell upon me! If you are tardy, you shall be scolded by all <em>nechi-nechi</em><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and fussy voice of that raised director-san, shall you not?”<br />
“…”</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Fuyuka herself told her that much, to have the girl recite it again, there was something which made her feel pretty uncomfortable. However, as it was truth to a certain extent, Fuyuka determined to silently leave the house at the time.</p>

<p>♢</p>

<p>(I hope she is all right.)</p>

<p>Fuyuka persistently warned the girl not to open the door if someone comes. It is possible for a pair of people to settle down in that flat as long as it was talked through, although basically for single person’s use.<br />
Hence, she has also told the girl not to go out unprepared. Of course, for she cannot for ever stay confined there during all weekdays, the pair means to settle that matter on the next weekend.</p>

<p>(… I’m worried.)</p>

<p>None the less, for Fuyuka, the idea of the girl to remain alone, enclosed with the walls of the house, was hitherto nothing but point of agitation.</p>
