<div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <p>Even considering the state of her mind before sleep, Fuyuka seemed to have gone through so many events and accumulated so much tiredness in a single day that drowsiness overcame her before she knew it.</p>

<p>“Umm, mn…?”</p>

<p>The moment Fuyuka opened her eyes, she found the rays of a faint, morning sun already flowing in between the curtains, carrying a bright change from the night’s darkness with them.</p>

<p>“Mmn…”<br />
<!--excerpt--></p>

<p>Being attacked by lethargy peculiar to awakening, she glimpsed at the smart phone which she put charging at her bedside. It was still only a little past seven. Seldom had Fuyuka woken up this early in the morning on her day off, and even if she had, it was typically to fall asleep once again.</p>

<p>Today was different, however.</p>

<p>“Hh!”</p>

<p>She recalled a sudden appearance of the vixen yesterday. On top of everything else that happened yesterday, they also fell asleep together on the same futon. <em>Whoosh</em>, springing up, Fuyuka glanced next to her.</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>There was not a sign of the​ other, though.<br />
She considered for a moment, “Was that all actually a dream?” But apparently, a small dent where the girl had slept remained. In addition, she could hear the noise of frying, as well as a cute, little humming coming from the kitchen.<br />
Fuyuka crawled up from the futon, and, unsteady as she was, made her way to the kitchen. As expected, she found Ohana standing in front of the stove.</p>

<p>“Oh, good morning! Could I have woken you up?”<br />
“No… I went to bed early last night, I think I woke up on my own. Oh—, good morning… And… what are you doing?”<br />
“There were some eggs, so I thought I should fry them firstly, and I also wanted to master the gas stove.”<br />
“Are you okay dealing with this? Like, fire.”</p>

<p>Considering that Fuyuka knew of a keenly biased, time-worn knowledge of the other’s, “Hopefully it went all right,” she wished; but to her surprise, Ohana appeared to reliably acquire the correct information upon this area.<br />
Naturally, it would be beyond endurance if the flat was set ablaze, so Fuyuka stroked her chest down, relieved for the moment.</p>

<p>“No need to worry, I am careful with fire. Although, I have had a hard time back then…”</p>

<p>Watching Ohana state that with rare to her distant look. “What could have happened?”—Fuyuka grew curious. However, she sealed her lips, for she felt she must not dig deeper into it.<br />
So after that, Fuyuka went to wash her face and brush her teeth. The early morning view from the window appeared refreshingly foreign somehow.</p>

<p>“Fuyuka-san—, how do you usually eat bread—?”<br />
“Er, I just eat it like that—.”</p>

<p>Replying to Ohana, whose voice echoed from the kitchen, and wiping her face, she went back. The pan that was frying the eggs a moment ago was roasting wieners now.</p>

<p>“Sorry about it. There is nothing else.”<br />
“No, not at all, it is fine, we shall buy plenty today. From tomorrow on, we shall do it right! After all, breakfast is the opening of the day!”</p>

<p>Honestly, Fuyuka felt like she had a lavish breakfast already, even if it comprises but fried eggs and bread.<br />
On weekdays, she would rush out of the house without so much as spending a moment on eating, whereas on weekends she would chiefly sleep until the noon.</p>

<p>“So, we shall go when we are ready then! Go to that huge and perilous supermarket!”<br />
“I think you’ve misinterpreted me there, but sure, after a short rest.”</p>

<p>While a little surprised to find herself unusually active today, Fuyuka had a relaxing time at breakfast with Ohana.</p>

<p>After that, when dishes were washed, Fuyuka and Ohana strode their way towards the station. Ohana was wearing the same <em>kimono</em> as yesterday.<br />
It seems that she is capable of producing it by magic, but Fuyuka could not follow her explanation in the least. Among everything else, she resolved to buy Ohana  clothes one of these days.<br />
For today, however, they head for the supermarket in front of the station. It is a five-storey building with food-related items occupying the first and second storeys, and hobby items, miscellaneous goods, and clothes upon the upper storeys.</p>

<p>(Taking the opportunity, perhaps it may be as well to buy underwear.)</p>

<p>“Whoah~!”</p>

<p>Ohana was letting out more admiration than when they went to yesterday’s supermarket. It definitely is a world apart in terms of dimension, and because it is forenoon on a weekend, there are countless visitors, too.</p>

<p>“Let’s take a look around the groceries first. Let me know if there is something to your taste.”</p>

<p>After she made a withdrawal at the bank in front of the station, today her wallet is full.</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Fuyuka-san? Then pray teach me what it is that you like. First things first, the lunch!”<br />
“No, let’s have <em>bento</em> for the lunch.”<br />
“Eh? why so!?”<br />
“It takes time, and we must take it easy at lunch. That’s why we should rather focus on dinner.”<br />
“H-haah… Well, if that’s all right with you. Then what would you fancy for dinner?”<br />
“Umm—, it’s quite abrupt… difficult to decide—. Oh, then, prepare the one you are most confident with.”<br />
“Most confident… Umm—, understood! Pray leave it to me today!”</p>

<p>Stated <em>kimono</em>-girl, sprinting off.</p>

<p>“Hey, wait! Do you know the place!? Wait—!”</p>

<p>Fuyuka realised just how long it has been since the last time she went shopping. Nevertheless, she felt strangely fulfilled. That is, even though, after making all sorts of purchases, their luggage was bulky, and the way home had been woeful​ for either of them.</p>

<p>It was evening of that hectic day.</p>

<p>“Uh, yay, seriously…”</p>

<p>Fuyuka’s voice naturally brimmed with astonishment at the crowd of dishes of Japanese cuisine that was laid out in front of her.</p>

<p>“Fu-fu, how do you like it! I had a lengthy training, the flavour is guaranteed!”<br />
“Mmm, these sure look tasty…”</p>

<p>Seasoning here must be different from the place where Ohana used to live, but she already handles it so smoothly,<!--changed--> or perhaps she was good at it from the outset.<br />
The main course was a boiled fish, a new sight for someone who subsists on <em>bento</em> with meat or deep-fried products.</p>

<p>“Come, come, let us eat!”<br />
“Ah, oh, rice with <em>miso</em> soup, fish with cold <em>tofu</em>… It looks to me like set meal restaurant.”</p>

<p>Fuyuka could not but admire. The air was filled with a pleasant scent, and for the first time in a long while, she was feeling genuine hunger.</p>

<p>“Th-then, I’ll help myself…”<br />
“Kindly, kindly!”</p>

<p>Fuyuka inserts her chopsticks into the fish stew timidly, and lifts the piece up to her lips. A tender flesh of the fish melts in her mouth, the delicious flavour spreads slowly but steadily. Instinctively, she added rice that she had not cooked in ages to the fish as well, slowly savouring it.</p>

<p>“S-so good…”<br />
“Delicious, is it not! Pray eat more! There is a second helping of rice, too!”<br />
“Th-thank you for the meal~~.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Fuyuka’s wife, Ohana, had perfectly captured her stomach.</p>
