    <p>Being told of something as fixed regulations, Fuyuka could not quite follow.<br />
At any rate, the most worrisome point is that what Ohana in front of her eyes intends to do onwards.</p>

<p>“And because you’re my wife we will be living together, isn’t this so?”<br />
“So, so that is, of course…!”<br />
<!--excerpt--></p>

<p>Not a trace of fluctuate might she note within the girl’s answer. Girl honestly means to reside together with her in the flat.<br />
None the less, cohabitation with the girl of appearance of tender years, even if they of the same sex, is not something she can lightly nod to.</p>

<p>(How does she plan to obtain resident card and go through a whole lot of other formalities, to begin with! Or rather, what happens if someone finds out that I brought a child of this apparent age to my house!? Will I be arrested!? I will be arrested!?)</p>

<p>Fuyuka turned pale, picturing her taking​ into custody on suspicion of abduction. She is not very anxious to be taken away wearing a mask, and receive shutters from mass media.</p>

<p>(N-no good, I have to refuse.)</p>

<p>After already admitting Ohana into her house, this thought had crossed her again. During the time, Ohana in front of her eyes gazed at lady of such mental agony with the look of puzzlement.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, is something troubling you? I shall do whatever I can!”<br />
“No, I just still don’t have enough information to know if it’s trouble.”<br />
“Information? Pray question me whatever you want! From now on, we are the wife-wife couple! Let us avoid as many secrets as possible!”</p>

<p>Accent on the expression “wife-wife”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> was peculiar; postponing​ thinking about it, however, Fuyuka tossed the question regardless:</p>

<p>“Mmh… Wife, you say… What are you planning to do exactly?”<br />
“What do? Let’s see, when it comes to being a wife, I shall be in charge of cooking, washing, cleaning, and so on. That is, warming up the place to your return, Hiiragi-sama! And why, Hiiragi-sama, of course I should take care of your personal needs, too! For this purpose, I’ve also duly studied upon cosmetics and hairdressing, to name a few.”<br />
“I see, I see…”</p>

<p>Apparently, Ohana’s image of the wife taints slightly old-fashioned concept. However, for Fuyuka whose employment induced considerable burden, Ohana’s offer seemed pretty appealing.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, as Fuyuka listened her out, Ohana’s presentation shed some light upon her aim.<!--???--><br />
The degree of difficulty of sending her out like this is at its summit, too.<!--no too--> After all, no matter how one would look at it, her appearance is that of a child, and after being driven out of here, she will be clueless as to what to do next. Also, there is no guarantee that her person will not befall the assault from some deviant, or that she will not be engaged into some kind of incident. If that were to take a place, Fuyuka’s nights would doubtlessly turn sleepless.<br />
Hence, she has to ascertain what ensues in case of refusal.</p>

<p>“So now, if I refuse you?”<br />
“Eh!? No, please don’t!? Whatever my lack is!? I’ll correct it instantly—please name whatever it is that is to your discontent!”<br />
“I-it’s not like that! I’m asking ‘if’, only ‘if’! Or rather, too close…!”</p>

<p>She managed to uncover her lips whilst restraining Ohana, who has neared herself over the table, by either hand. Perceiving that, “Fum—,”<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> after a moment of alert, girl replied:</p>

<p>“In case if events must take such turn, my time would probably pass at the Shinto shrine, where I met you. For I arrived here in favour of living together with you, I am incapable of return until the curtain of your life shall fall.”<br />
“E-erm… Is that certain?”<br />
“Yes; for we are such family.”</p>

<p>On the bright side, if Fuyuka face it outright, she would be in the company of beautiful vixen for remainder of her life.<br />
Facing it honestly, she is quite fond of girl’s appearance: wholesome, spirited, and also earnestly devoted (possibly the finest company as a spouse).<br />
However, in view of social-scape, public opinions, and all the rest she cannot be loyal to her cravings.</p>

<p>Fuyuka was torn. Should she accept or reject the offer? Each comprise merits and demerits, and then, again, probably for Fuyuka’s desires also happened to blend in, she has no resolve in her reach.<br />
Amidst such an anguish, the voice of Ohana surfaced gently:</p>

<p>“Hiiragi-sama, Hiiragi-sama, you are terribly forworn right now, are you not?”<br />
“Eh?”<br />
“I have a feeling it’s like so. Withal confused too, for my visit is so unforeseen, are you not…?”<br />
“That’s… might be true.”</p>

<p>In fact, she was exhausted. She could shatter by ill fortune and anxiety before long. Under such set of circumstances, it was but sane that so suddenly chanced collision with the vixen-maiden should render her haggard.</p>

<p>“I-I assume you have the right to be upset about this sort of happening out of nowhere! Among us, there were some who had been well-nigh executed, after quarrels due to misunderstandings at first interview.”<br />
“Executed…”</p>

<p>Fuyuka was at a loss, “When in the world did it happen?” Obviously, even supposing she had the ability to order someone’s execution, she would never have an attitude of doing anything about this young and sweet creature.</p>

<p>“Hiiragi-sama, I understand you are a person of great kindness. Doubtless a great mental exhaustion it is to involuntarily<!--TODO: involuntarily?--> protect various people—to lend them a hand—so I assume.”</p>

<p>The encounter have happened only few hours ago, and in spite of that, Fuyuka was overwhelmed to find Ohana read her subconscious essence as book.<br />
She is, as Ohana say, a soft-hearted person. By no means a good person, but <em>is</em> a type to be bothered, thinking, for instance, <!--"I have committed a blunder somewhere, have I not,"-->“It was all because of me, wasn’t it,” even if the other party is at fault.</p>

<p>“And for this exact reason you had kindness to listen me out—me, who have shown up without any warning—and not merely cast me aside… I so truly yearn to spend my time together with such kind-hearted lady.”</p>

<p>Listening to these words, Fuyuka felt her heart throb. Never had anyone asked her before in this way, not since she became a cog in society.</p>

<p>“It’s only once, pray welcome me provisionally? And then, if you find it unacceptable on no account, I shall take my leave. Would this be all right…?”</p>

<p>Ohana of as yet childish looks bowed her head profoundly. Fuyuka, too, recognised her apprehension, for her vixen’s ears were slightly prone.</p>

<p>(Why in the world are you going so far… for someone like me.)</p>

<p>Fuyuka doesn’t consider herself an attractive person. As a matter of fact, she has got some good looks of her own, and public does not rate her that bad. However, being ignorant of it as she is, she undervalues herself a ton.<br />
Hearing Ohana’s proposal, though, she has been able to partly settle herself down.<br />
And, ignoring her <em>Youko</em> origin, throwing her out is unthinkable, even though she is a senior; painful it is to imagine her, <em>potsun</em>,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> spending her time desolate, all by herself at that shrine.</p>

<p>“… Understood. Let’s call it provisional then…”</p>

<p>Accordingly, she determined to follow Ohana’s suggestion. Albeit Fuyuka was unsure of lapse of the time to be considered provisional, she concluded that, “Surely she will drain out her amiability in no time and withdraw from here speedily.”<br />
The scars of her former life hitherto lingered intimately within her heart.</p>

<p>“Uwah—, thank you so much! I shall do my best being your wife, please look forward to it!”</p>

<p>Fuyuka responded to Ohana’s miniature hand presented across the table in diffident manner. Feminine miniature but warm hand felt both awkward and pleasant.</p>
