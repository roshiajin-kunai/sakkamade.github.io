<div class="content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <p>Fuyuka has caught a cold. It was a perfect cold. So it was solid, so well-timed, that could only be called perfect.</p>

<p>“Um-umgh…”</p>

<p>The discomfort of an irritated throat ​and the lassitude brought on by a fever. Even though it is summer, a chill she felt in her body clearly suggested her feeling unwell.</p>

<p><em>Beep-beep-beep</em>, the thermometer under​ her arm produced a sound, indicating the end of the measurement. Taking it from Fuyuka and casting a look at it, Ohana’s face tinted a surprise.</p>

<p>“Eight and thirty degrees… It was not so terrible yesterday.”</p>

<p>In truth, Fuyuka’s condition had been delicate lately. Herself she assumed that it merely is a light fatigue, and that she would be fine.<br />
However this is how it came to be.</p>

<p>“Umhm—… First I have to cancel the flight… then I have to call home… ohana—, please, Phone…”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br />
“Y-yes…!”</p>

<p>Of course, in no way could Ohana​ make the call in her stead. She hurriedly unplugged the smart phone from charging cable, and passed it to Fuyuka.</p>

<p>“… Yes, I am terribly sorry, but I do need to cancel—— Yes, yes, I understand.”</p>

<p>First, she contacted the airline, whereafter followed a call to her parents’ house.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mother? … Mhm, that’s me. Umm, well, I have a cold. Yes, sorry, I don’t think I can come this time… Um, don’t worry, I’m okay, after all, there is someone who can look after me…”<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>Reacted Ohana to the words emerged from Fuyuka during the call. What expressed her  thought of “Is it all right to say so?”<br />
Sure enough, the voice coming from the phone grew noticeably louder. Perhaps her mother on the other end had remarked something to her, as her flu-red visage coloured a flush of a distinct nature.<!--changed--></p>

<p>“What!? No, it’s diff——! Not a lover, no, that is not what I——! A-anyway, geez, I have to go to the hospital now! Bye!”</p>

<p>If she held the receiver, she should have—<em>clunk!</em>—slammed it down violently. Thus Fuyuka finished the call, breathing hard.<br />
Her breathing was laboured, of course, partly due to her influenza; but even her face had turned quite crimson. Ohana became worried and spoke to her:</p>

<p>“Um… How do you feel…?”<br />
“I-I’m fine. No, physically I’m not fine at all, though…”<!--changed--></p>

<p>A pained breath seem to accompany the sigh that escaped her lips, making Ohana beside herself with agitation. Fortunately, today was the opening day of a consecutive holiday weekend and lady had a three days off, and being that they are succeeded by weekend she had five days in hand.<br />
Having drunk only some water, as the appetite left her due to a high fever, lady glanced her eyes at the clock.</p>

<p>“The hospital… it’s just near the station… Right…”<br />
“A-are you leaving on foot? It is dangerous!”<br />
“D-don’t worry, I’ll take a cab… Of course I will…”</p>

<p>Wobbly and weakly, Fuyuka changed her clothes, and, whilst Ohana anxiously and hastily helped her, ​whispered faintly:</p>

<p>“Can’t you catch a cold… Ohana?”<br />
“We are different from humans in the first place… I do not think we may be affected by that kind of disease.”<br />
“R-really? That’s good to hear… I’ll be out for a bit, so please watch the room while I’m gone.”</p>

<p>After getting dressed and checking her wallet and insurance card, Fuyuka tried to leave the house with tottering steps. She appeared to be in so much a pain that Ohana resolved to escort her until she got into a cab. On the occasion, she passed the purse that was handed to her for shopping errands into her bosom.</p>

<p>“Ugh—, I never imagined I’d catch a cold with such pinpoint accuracy…”<br />
“Shame you could not visit your parents…”<br />
“Well, I guess, somewhat because I lost the opportunity to visit them… but worst of all is that it will ruin my holidays… Really the worst.”<br />
“It certainly is a pity…”</p>

<p>Doubtless, for her, the always busy with work person, the holidays were a moment of bliss. An undeniable reality of losing even a few days of them as yet seemed to be beyond her.</p>

<p>A short walk from Fuyuka’s apartment lead them to the main street. There is no cab stand, and Fuyuka decides to call a cab from there.</p>

<p>“Yes. Yes… there. Yes, thank you.”</p>

<p>The cab arrived shortly after Fuyuka finished the call. With effort, she got into it, and asked the driver to take her to the hospital.</p>

<p>“Well then, it might take some time… Please make sure you lock the door.”<br />
“Y-yes, I will. Take care of yourself.”<br />
“I’m off, then…”</p>

<p>Fuyuka said, and the cab departed. “If it is near the station, it should not take that long, and the hospital would take care of the rest for her.” With that in mind, Ohana then wondered what she could do next.<br />
My, there are a few matters she needs to attend to.<!--changed--></p>

<p>“Anyhow, shopping, I suppose.”</p>

<p>She already had knowledge that human might fall ill. After organising in her mind what kind of food one should prepare when a person has a cold, what sort of environment she should set up, she immediately proceed to walk. Naturally, the ​destination was not home, but a department store in front of the station.</p>

<p>“I must support her in times like these… Let’s hurry.”</p>

<p>Ohana did not know how much time would hospital take, but by no means could she create a situation where she would not be there by Fuyuka’s return. In order to avoid upsetting her ailing Fuyuka, Ohana hastened to the store.</p>
