    <p>Every morning Fuyuka was leaving the house with heavy step. Despite that it is the city, and the area over here—in residential district—is artificial, the nature is also yet here, so the song of cicadas was buzzing in the air.<br />
To walk out in the sunshine and the buzz of cicadas is definitely hard, and in all honestly, a mere thought of having to walk to the station makes Fuyuka uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Have a good day.”<br />
“… Right.”</p>

<p>However, going through​ it with tolerance is the essence of working people. Being seen off by Ohana, Fuyuka proceeded to walk down the street to her workplace.</p>

<p>Such has become their daily routine these days. But Ohana has it hard enough either, doing household chores in so hot a weather, and ensuring the balanced meals to keep Fuyuka from exhaustion.<br />
It was one of such evenings amid their groove.</p>

<p>“Eh? The Obon?”<br />
“Yes. Even at my company we have a few days off due to Obon. There I visit my parents every year, but what about you, Ohana, what would you do during the time?”</p>

<p>Fuyuka’s notice was plain: She will leave the apartment for three days to visit her parents on Obon. For Fuyuka, she was rather concerned about Ohana’s well-being than of her own trip.</p>

<p>“In case if it would bring no inconvenience, I could probably simply remain here…”</p>

<p>There was little choice as her action, however; Ohana is correct, there was nothing to do but to let her stay there, in the apartment.</p>

<p>“Ohana, well, I’m positive that if it’s you you will be fine… but it would be bad if someone finds out about your being here, so don’t answer the door no matter who comes. If everything goes well, I’ll be back by the third evening.”<br />
“Understood. I should manage it!”</p>

<p>She used to feel uneasy about the girl, but presently, after spending so much time jointly, she no longer has such fear. This is how dependable Ohana proved to be.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, Ohana, don’t you have that kind of visiting-home tradition?”<!--changed--><br />
“Visiting… home?”<br />
“Mhm. Isn’t there a place like that? Is it near that shrine?”</p>

<p>Fuyuka recalled to her mind their encounter in early spring.<br />
The wonder when the girl emerged suddenly of out the gentle rain, and then wonder still as the girl introduced herself as her future wife, whereafter, somehow, they ended up living together.<br />
She may be as she is, but this in no way implies she has nowhere to go. From conversations they had had once, there appears to be a kind of hamlet she used to reside in.</p>

<p>(Wait. I mean, if there is a village Ohana can return to, why not she just return there?)</p>

<p>Not until she questioned did she realise that, but Ohana shook her head, a little lonesome:</p>

<p>“There is, but I cannot leave here for the time being. Although, I am able to get in touch with the person who raised me, Ren-shi-sama…”[^1]<br />
“I see… I figured as much, sorry about that.<!--???--><!--changed--> But, that personage, don’t you have to stay in touch? It has been several months since you came here.”<br />
“I suppose it’s almost time for my report… Only, I cannot unless I reach that shrine.”</p>

<p>Thus, this could be done but at Shinto shrine where she first met Fuyuka,  Ohana explained. The spot, however, is a fair distance away by train. It should be all right, but she felt slightly restless.</p>

<p>“Then we will head there when I come back.”<br />
“We can?”<br />
“You’ve been doing so much for me, this much is perfectly fine. And I reckon not hearing from you for too long will make them worry, too.”<br />
“Th-thank you so much!”</p>

<p>Joyfully extended her gratitude Ohana for Fuyuka’s suggestion. It was a small price to pay for the housecraft behind the girl.<!--changed--></p>

<p>“Very well, that is that, then. Umm, even though it is only a mid-August now, still a long way off, but please look out for me.”<br />
“Yes, understood!”</p>

<p>And so the days went by after their promise, when, in no time at all, the day has approached them.<br />
Unsurprisingly, the summer confirmed to be fiercely hot—hot from dawn to dusk, with sultry nights in-between; such lasted for days on end. There, Fuyuka presently was supposed to be the one to depart, nonetheless…</p>

<p>“… <em>Uugh—, cough, cough</em>!”​<br />
“Awa-awa-awa…<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  Fuyuka-san, are you all right…”<br />
“Sorry about—— Give me another glass of water.”<br />
“Y-yes! I shall be right back!”</p>

<p>Albeit the day of her departure has come, she did not even quit the futon: Her face flushed with red, her eyes shook with impotence. It was hot in the morning, so they had the air conditioner mildly on, and yet Fuyuka perspired profusely, worse still, she looked to be in a terrible pain.</p>

<p>A severe summer cold. Unfortunately, upon the very first day of her holidays, Fuyuka was stricken with that.</p>
