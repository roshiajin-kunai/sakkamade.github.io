Today I have moved forth the test-version of ~~slightly~~ redesigned web-site.
It is very rough now, and will work only in modern browsers (IE, for instance, had not been even tested), but what else do we need, right?
That said, the web-site is still WIP (ever since the very December), and some bugs are present indeed.

But I love its fresh look!

The user experience was improved for both PC and mobile devices.

#### Some brief moments of importance.

For Mobile:
- Removed bottom menu and bottom "sidebar" (like in Updates page), scroll-to-bottom button have become more useful
- Decreased height of header (image is quite removed for now)
- The overlay "Menu" in place of sidebar at the bottom

For PC:
- Column-layout persists in every page, including Publication's pages
- Brightness of the background of primary (main) column higher than of secondary (sidebar) to reduce factor of distraction

For both:
- TOC of Publicationâ€™s pages and Date filter in Archives were moved to sidebar (to "Menu" for mobile users)

P.s. The flowers shall return.
P.p.s. Mobile users, I know it has not much of menu look from user's point, but tap  the "Archive," the "About" in it will sent the user to respective page. I wonder if I need to think of name for a bit more.
