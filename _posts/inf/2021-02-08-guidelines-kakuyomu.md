#### Registration
{: class="with-indent"}

Shall we register in <em>kakuyomu</em> so to support the author since we like this novel so much? <br />Yes? Here we go then:
{: class="first-paragraph"}
First of all go over <a href="https://kakuyomu.jp/works/4852201425154961396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kakuyomu.jp</a>.<br /> Then in that page click a blue button on the top---

![reg1](/assets/img/kakuyomu-guide/omg-kakuyomu-reg1.png){: class="white-img" onclick="window.open(this.src)"}
<span class="small no-js-none">(Click/ touch image to enlarge it)</span>
{: style="text-align: center" }

Type in your e-mail, password, &c.<br /> Uncheck receiving e-mails (if you want to), click a  mark box for your agreements with guidelines and click a blue button.

![reg2](/assets/img/kakuyomu-guide/omg-kakuyomu-reg2.png){: class="white-img" onclick="window.open(this.src)"}

After some time you'll receive an e-mail message. Just follow the web-link in it. <br /><br /> For further logging in, click here---

![log-in-1](/assets/img/kakuyomu-guide/omg-kakuyomu-log-in.png){: class="white-img" onclick="window.open(this.src)"}

That's all for registration ヾ(＠⌒ー⌒＠)ﾉ

#### Stop receiving e-mails
{: class="with-indent"}

Some people (such as myself) do not wish to trash the e-mail box with unwanted messages. Upon registration it is possible to disable receiving other e-mails from <em>kakuyomu</em> as well.

After log in, hover your nickname and click following string---

![email1](/assets/img/kakuyomu-guide/omg-kakuyomu-no-email1.png){: class="white-img" onclick="window.open(this.src)"}

Next, choose a second tab and scroll to the very bottom.

![email2](/assets/img/kakuyomu-guide/omg-kakuyomu-no-email2.png){: class="white-img" onclick="window.open(this.src)"}

Check the boxes circled on image below and click a blue button.

![email3](/assets/img/kakuyomu-guide/omg-kakuyomu-no-email3.png){: class="white-img" onclick="window.open(this.src)"}

(Certainly you can check the other as well, but first section for notifications _in_ the website, it is not annoying and rather useful.)

Now we are freed from receiving any kinds of e-mails from this website.
