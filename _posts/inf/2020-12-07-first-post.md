Hello. This is the first actual post on my  website powered by *GitHub*. I'm Sakkani, the one who established group *sakkamade*.


This time I'd like to narrate about my first acquaintanceship with Japanese fiction and movies.
<!-- more -->

With *manga* I became familiar not a long ago. That was, if I recall correctly, in August of 2019. And the name of it - "Citrus". Finding it after casual encounter with some fan-art, firstly I watched an *anime*. At that time, my novice self didn't possessed a knowledge that all *anime* are based on *manga*. I presume that was a second *anime* I've ever seen. Late bloomer, huh. Rather, I was never a favour of movies and TV-shows. 
"Citrus" remains as the one of my favourite *anime* and *manga* up until now. "The one of" since not too long ago to the very top came an *anime* "Liz to Aoi Tori". And *manga*... Hmm, I wonder, there were plenty of nice pieces.


The first Japanese novel I read was "I Favor the Villainess". Best part I consider <span class="spoiler">the story about Rei's past.</span>
Discovered it in March of 2020 via fan-artwork as well, but this time it was in the translator's credits of some *manga*. Read it up to August of the same year (mainly in August, in couple of days.) <del>Gosh, what's wrong with this August.</del> And ever since then I've started to read much more novels and less *manga*. 
It's so hard to find an interesting one, gosh...
Favourite novel  is "Adachi to Shimamura". No doubt.

Now a little about the website. 
Work on it almost completed, in sense - I already can post here without any problems and you can read. However, I guess, there's still a lot of things needs to be done.
I don't think here will be likes and comments, so, if you really wish to talk with me, I can think up and do something about it.
This website will have an *Atom* feed (RSS). Although I have no idea how does it work, there shouldn't be any problems with notifications of new posts, if you know how to use it.


Well, that's it for now. Best regards.
