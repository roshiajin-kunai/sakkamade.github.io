    <p>Today it has been raining since the morning.<!-- more --><br />
Not <em>potsu-potsu</em>, however, but <em>zaa-zaa</em>.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br />
Looked forward to sea trip Lydia, now being crestfallen, and sits upon the library floor.</p>

<p>“Why-, is it raining now-.”</p>

<p>Let out a sigh Lydia.</p>

<p>“There are days like this.”</p>

<p>Stated Yuuyami, during brushing Lydia’s hair.</p>

<p>“I wanted to go to the sea–.”<br />
“Let us go tomorrow.”<br />
“What if it rains tomorrow?”<br />
“Let us go the day after tomorrow.”<br />
“What if it rains the day after tomorrow?”<br />
“Let us construct a car.”<br />
“I like motorcycles better–.”<br />
“Why?”<br />
“Hm—,” Lydia inclined her head to the side.</p>

<p>There no definite pretext in particular. Nonetheless, if her forced to answer,</p>

<p>“Is it because motorbike’s, cooler?”<br />
“That is a question for me?”<br />
“No. It’s just a bit ambiguous.”<br />
“I see.”</p>

<p>Indifferently said Yuuyami, and continued combing Lydia’s hair.<br />
In beatitude, Lydia closed her eyes.</p>

<p>“Incidentally.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami stopped her hand. Naming it as being done with brushing.<br />
Lydia considers it regrettable, however she shall be combed  tomorrow  morning again. Therefore did not ask, “More”.</p>

<p>“What?”<br />
“For what reason have you suddenly wishing to visit a sea?”<br />
“Hm—? What—? Aren’t I mentioned it in the middle of the night?”<br />
“You are not. For that right after uttering a statement, of you wishing to go to the sea, you fell asleep, as yet standing.”<br />
“I see.”</p>

<p>Lydia considered she fall asleep upon explaining thing.</p>

<p>“Er, I saw sea. Sea dream.”</p>

<p>Lydia has never seen actual sea. Nonetheless, she knew the scenery out of movies, books, et cetera.<br />
It is azure, immense, chilly, deep, wavy, and salty.</p>

<p>“Dream?”<br />
“Yes; dream.”</p>

<p>And after a brief​ silence,</p>

<p>“What kind of dream? Inasmuch as I do not dream, I am having a keen interest,” stated Yuuyami.</p>

<p>Autodoll are not seeing dreams.<br />
Likewise Lydia aware of that fact. After all, Yuuyami never sleep in the first place.</p>

<p>“Er, there was a sandy beach, there was sea, and then—,” was saying Lydia, trying to recall fragments of her dream: “sparkling flower was in bloom.”<br />
“Sparkling flower?”<br />
“Hm. You know, er, that… flower that means rainbow. Purple one.”<br />
“Aah,” nods Yuuyami. “Iris, right?”<br />
“Yes. Iris.”</p>

<p>Lydia leaned behind and pressed her head against Yuuyami’s bosom. Yuuyami’s chest feels good as a pillow.</p>

<p>“Hmm. And then?”<br />
“Er—, it was blooming at top of the sea. And was a little wavering.”<br />
“Iris is not blooms at the sea surface.”<br />
“I know–.”</p>

<p>With a sour look, Lydia restored her posture by separating of Yuuyami’s chest.</p>

<p>“It’s dream after all.”</p>

<p>Whereas saying that, Lydia sat down facing Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“That is right. A frequent situation for dream to be absurd.”<br />
“Hm—, now I remember distinctly. Iris was swaying, sea strongly attracted me. I had to move towards, were my thoughts.”<br />
“I see. Dream seem to have meaning. Then sha…”<br />
“Look it up with oneiromancy.”</p>

<p>Lydia interrupted Yuuyami words. Even so, no problem has appeared. Since Yuuyami certainly wanted to propose oneiromancy.</p>

<p>“Yes. Pray wait a moment.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami stood up, took a tablet idling upon the desk and came back.<br />
Then, sits before Lydia operating a tablet.<br />
Whereas Lydia excitingly wondered, what kind of meaning would it be.</p>

<p>“Appears that sea having various sorts of meaning,” says Yuuyami. “First of all, what kind of sea was that?”<br />
“Er, calm, glittering, transparent, and awfully beautiful.”<br />
“I see. What were Lydia impression at time?”<br />
“Wa—h, so beautiful!”<br />
“How unsophisticated.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami let to slip a short giggle.</p>

<p>“So what’s the meaning?”<br />
“Yes. It is very good dream. Overall it have a great implication, either large happiness might arrive or became known, particularly when it comes to romance. As following, means the talent blooming or growth.”<br />
“Romance is the love, right?”<br />
“Indeed. It is similar.”<br />
“Iris also had a definition of love fulfilment, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Upon the moment she learned about oneiromancy with Yuuyami for the first time, since that day Lydia have been continuously yearning for Yuuyami.<br />
Albeit, however<br />
at time of watching movies and reading books, it appeared as Lydia’s love was somewhat different.<br />
Despite that, her love toward Yuuyami, as well as desire to stay together with her, haven’t altered.</p>

<p>“Yes. In sooth.”<br />
“Are fulfilled love brings even larger happiness?”</p>

<p>But, what would be even greater happiness than at present, wondered Lydia.<br />
Yuuyami was brushing a hair for me, exploring, creating various things, what kind of happiness shall be beyond?<br />
Lydia cannot even imagine.</p>

<p>“However iris was swaying, was it?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami slightly bent her neck.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. It was.”<br />
“That means the fulfilled love would tremor and new love shall commence, it seems?”<br />
“Eh? I’m not particularly wishing for another, new love, though?”</p>

<p>Since Yuuyami is sufficient.</p>

<p>“Is that so?”<br />
“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>Lydia firmly stared upon Yuuyami, Yuuyami  was also regarding  Lydia.<br />
Gazes intersection. Lydia was reflecting within clear pupils of Yuuyami, and surely Yuuyami were there, in the middle of Lydia azure​ eyes.<br />
Accompanied by leisure flow of the time, suddenly, Lydia recalled a matter she wished to discuss with Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami, wait a moment.”</p>

<p>Without awaiting for Yuuyami to response, Lydia stood up and pick her tablet from sofa.<br />
Immediately reinstating her original posture of sitting directly before Yuuyami, facing her.</p>

<p>“I wanted to create a world map.”</p>

<p>Lydia showed tablet screen to Yuuyami.<br />
Within the middle of a white screen can be found a symbol of opened book, with written, “Underground Library (Residence of Lydia and Yuuyami),” thereunder.</p>

<p>“So that’s what it was. A world map?”<br />
“Yes. Since exploration is so rare, I thought it would be fun to make a map.”</p>

<p>A circled symbol <strong>P</strong>, was right by west side of underground library. Whereas meaning a parking lot, upon Lydia’s map is an indication of the garage.<br />
To the east side, symbol that combines cogwheel​ and electric circuit. This one points out a solar panels constructed by Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Good, is not it. We shall bury the white world with symbols.”<br />
“Uh-huh. I’ve  pointed Rapha’s house at once, you know.”</p>

<p>With that said, Lydia scrolls a screen.<br />
Approximately forty-four kilometres north underground library, upon the map has been pointed a square symbol and following words: “House of Rapha and Ohan.”</p>

<p>“Nicely done. Then next shall become a sea.”<br />
“Yes. By the way, Yuuyami, at what direction the sea?”</p>

<p>For Lydia the sea location  as yet undisclosed. Decided to travel there, just like that, without knowing neither direction nor distance.</p>

<p>“Departing due south, upon approximately fifty kilometres, we shall reach it.”<br />
“And other directions?”<br />
“Other? Let’s see–.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami displayed a pondering gesture. Undoubtedly was referring to fore-downfall world’s map, reckoned Lydia.</p>

<p>“Approximately one hundred forty kilometres to the east. About two hundred fifty kilometres to the north. Otherwise we have to travel nearly three hundred kilometres due the west.”<br />
“To south is nearest, right?”<br />
“Sure, that is right.”<br />
“So be it, straight towards the south!”<br />
“Yes. Let us do it.”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Yuuyami was observing Lydia eating lunch.<br />
Yuuyami do not eat anything. Energy provides the Power Cell.<br />
Hence, she simply enjoyed watching Lydia’s diet.<br />
Lydia’ lunch apropos was a salad and fruit juice. Lydia diet are not vast. However, having no problems with her health, Yuuyami mentions nothing  in particular against amount of the meal.<br />
After table, pair would decide on  order of precedence​ for projects.<br />
Upon increasing quantity of projects, they had been clueless as for what to begin with, unless choose on priorities.<br />
Lydia finishes eating a salad and  drains fruit juice in a big gulps.<br />
Thereafter, wearing a smile, said: “Thank you for the meal”.<br />
Why  was it necessary to utter such phrase, could not explain Yuuyami. Yuuyami haven’t teach her that.<br />
Lydia self-educates, memorizing and practising greetings before and after the meal.</p>

<p>“Well, then, prioritise the projects,” uttered Yuuyami.<br />
“Uh-huh. World exploring is number one.”<br />
“I agree.”<br />
“That’s why I pondered about it, drawing a conclusion to manufacture toil AD that would allow us to advance with projects during our exploration.”<br />
“Toil AD? I have never reasoned such.”<br />
“Since Yuuyami doesn’t get tired. But for I’m getting fatigued quickly, I want rather automate it.”</p>

<p>Indeed, Yuuyami nodded.<br />
For Yuuyami has an amount of working time no different from infinite, upon the premise she considered doing everything herself.<br />
However Lydia different. Time to rest and replenishment energy— meal hour was indispensable.<br />
Moreover,<br />
Lydia would die afore Yuuyami.<br />
Of course, it is mere matter for times to come.<br />
Subject of distant future.<br />
Notwithstanding that, Yuuyami grew extremely​ lonely.<br />
Average life expectancy among former human kind were around one hundred fifty years. What about Lydia, novel human breed?<br />
Can she subsist longer than bygone humanity?<br />
Hopefully so, desired Yuuyami.<br />
Whereas taking an oath.<br />
Without a fail obtain Angel Project materials with an aim of discovering a method to extend Lydia’s life-span.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami?”</p>

<p>Lydia tilted her head, Yuuyami interrupted a train of her thoughts.</p>

<p>“What is it?”<br />
“Would it be okay to give toil AD top priority?”<br />
“Yes. It is okay. What series would you wish to reproduce?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami select a catalogue of toil AD on the tablet, and showed it to Lydia.</p>

<p>“Firstly we must manufacture a versatile type. So, let’s build identical toil AD as you.”<br />
“I see. Then please choose in this direction.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Well, then, it will be latest V series model.”</p>

<p>Lydia operated tablet and picked out a toil AD.</p>

<p>“Yes. Versatile series, right.”</p>

<p>The type with uncovered metal skeletal structure, resembling Ohan a little. Well, this one’s smaller than Ohan and having no combat ability.</p>

<p>“We have software archive, aren’t we?”<br />
“Yes, we are. It should be within library database.”<br />
“Then we only have to prepare hardware.”<br />
“Inasmuch as we also have blueprints, it is feasible before long drive that in a simple Parts Maker.”<br />
“Ah, simple Parts Maker, I know.”<br />
“What is it?”<br />
“Why don’t we construct regular Parts Maker, not simplified version? For the future.”</p>

<p>Parts Maker a large machine. It has potential to reproduce whole motorcycle or car in one charge, too. Upon assembly labour turns  to be needless, work efficiency should greatly ascend.<br />
However is having a problems either.</p>

<p>“Where should we place it? We shall not possibly make it weather-beaten.”<br />
“Er, establish Maker Factory, let toil AD handle it.”<br />
“That is, fairly large-scale​d project, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Lydia declared constructing the factory in itself.<br />
If they use factory blueprints of fore-world’s collapse, there shall not be much for them to append.<br />
Nonetheless, if factory being built by toil AD, with mere two units of simple Parts Makers, project can take several months.<br />
During the time, rest of projects wouldn’t make a progress. Since simple Parts Makers would be occupied with factory construction.</p>

<p>“Um. But we just have to explore throughout that time, so it’s okay. If it would raining like today, we can design artificial intelligence for motorbike.”<br />
“Understood. We shall proceed forward this route.”<br />
“Then, let’s get started!”</p>

<p>Lydia cheerfully sprang up.<br />
If you create all sorts of objects such as this, one day world shall fill a hustle and bustle.<br />
Upon that time,<br />
Yuuyami would let out a short giggle, saying, ‘With just a Lydia it was lively enough’.</p>
