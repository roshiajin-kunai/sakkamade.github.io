So then, she pressed upon her chest to reassure: good, it have not stopped. Merely moving her head, Girl pointed her gaze in direction of the voice. The Lady1 was seated next to the Girl. She seemed to be completely a sculpture as though, or doll: not a living existence. By her appearance, she looked like seventeen or eighteen years of age Japanese female. Charming, long, black hair, forelock cut straight. Her constitution was average. The clothing, however, which she was wearing, were a little eccentric. The modest maid outfit. Skirt is awfully long: covered most of her legs. Her lineaments are delicate and fair. Each feature was flawless, so was and overall harmony.

<em>Phew</em>, Girl stroked her chest in relief. At the same moment, Girl heard, “Good morning,” a feminine  voice.<br />
Girl turned so startled that she thought her heart will stop. So then, she pressed upon her  chest to reassure: good, it have not stopped.<br />
Merely moving her head, Girl pointed her gaze in direction of the voice.<br />
The Lady<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  was seated next to the Girl. She seemed to be completely a sculpture as though, or doll: not a living existence.<br />
By her appearance, she looked like seventeen or eighteen years of age Japanese female. Charming, long, black hair, forelock cut straight.<br />
Her constitution was average. The clothing, however, which she was wearing, were a little eccentric. The modest maid outfit. Skirt is awfully long: covered most of her legs.<br />
Her lineaments are delicate  and fair. Each feature was flawless, so was and overall harmony. For Lady had been so beautiful, Girl felt slightly bashful.</p>

<p>“Good morning.”</p>

<p>Said Lady in very fluent Japanese. Pleasant, velvet voice. Girl had a feeling that recite a poem​ would suit her.</p>

<p>“My voice is normal, hence, if it does not get transmitted, most probable cause is an abnormality of your hearing sensor. Is a lip reading available?”</p>

<p>Lady have not even moved a muscle of her face, but indifferently stated so. For it was so impersonal,  Girl did not notice that that was question for a moment.<br />
Two seconds later, however, as Girl recognised it, she answered aloud: “I hear.”<br />
Voice of the Girl was not velvet as Lady’s, but immature, undeveloped one. Girl did not grieve over it, only a little disappointed.</p>

<p>“Is that so. Then, what about name?”<br />
“Your?”<br />
“No, yours.”<br />
“Mine?”<br />
“Yours, yes.”</p>

<p><em>Um—</em>,  hummed Girl. However no matter how much she dived into the sea of her ​memories, she could not imagine her past self. She hummed for awhile, nonetheless could recall nothing.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Shrugged her miniature shoulders Girl.</p>

<p>“I see. Memory disorder? Shall we perform the examination?”<br />
“Examination?”<br />
“Yes. I’m not a medical type, but I trust I may manage it with reference to database.”</p>

<p>Girl slightly tilted her head.<br />
Lady also inclined her head sideways, similarly.</p>

<p>“Who… are you?”<br />
“I am fourth generation of AD. The LM series, type Ⅱ.”</p>

<p>Girl re-tilted her head to the other side. Her hair ran down the cheek.<br />
Hair of the little girl is bright blonde and wavy-ish.</p>

<p>“My hair, it’s sparkling.”</p>

<p>Lighting of the room could be seen through  Girl’s hair.</p>

<p>“Yes. I find it rather pretty.”</p>

<p>Launched a smile Lady.<br />
“What a gentle smile,” thought the Girl.</p>

<p>“Say-, AD, what’s that-?”<br />
“AD is the abbreviation for Autodoll. Do you know what Autodoll is?”<br />
“I don’t really kn…“—the moment Girl begin to say that, something flashed through her mind,—”…ow—— I know. Probably.”</p>

<p>It was not a piece of memory, however. As knowledge, Girl was aware of  Autodoll. Albeit whether Girl had ever been involved with one was left unknown.</p>

<p>“I see,” Lady nodded.<br />
“Generic name​ of expensive robots, isn’t it?”<br />
“Correct. For the details it should be as well to review the database later.”<br />
“You are robot, then?”<br />
“Yes, I am. However, I possess consciousness.”<br />
“Consciousness? Not a will?”<br />
“Indeed. Nothing but consciousness dwell in my self. I am intelligent life-form.”<br />
“Is that how it is.”</p>

<p>Girl easily accepted her words. According to Girl’s knowledge, robots are not conscious. Despite that, Girl believed that Lady was, since she asserts to be.</p>

<p>“Am I an AD either?”<br />
“No. You are species which called a human.”<br />
“How is it different?”</p>

<p>Girl had no knowledge of humanity.</p>

<p>“Regarding this also should be as well to review the database on the details. For now I will only say that the body components are different.”</p>

<p>Girl looked down at her own body, next she surveyed Lady. She watched for several seconds, but it did not seem to have much  difference.</p>

<p>“The outward appearance is not so different. For we, AD, are designed after humankind. However the internal parts are completely distinct.”<br />
“Is that how it is.”<br />
“Yes. But we shall return to the previous subject. Would you like to perform examination?”</p>

<p>Girl shook her head sideways.</p>

<p>“Is this a refusal gesture?”<br />
“It’s not a strong refusal, okay?” Girl smiled: “It’s just won’t make a difference. So I feel.”<br />
“Then, you don’t have to?”<br />
“Uh-huh. Because it’s not important.”<br />
“What is not?”<br />
“The memory.”<br />
“Your action log is not important?”<br />
“Uh-huh. It’s meaningless to me.”<br />
“Why meaningless?”<br />
“I wonder. Sensuously I’m fine, it seems.”<br />
“Yes. So?”<br />
“Err, perhaps I had no memory…​ originally.”<br />
“I consider it unlikely. By eye, your age is from twelve to fourteen. In other words, you should have operated for this span of a time.”<br />
“Um—.”</p>

<p>“She also has a point,” thought the Girl. However, Girl feel no necessity to forcefully awake her memory.<br />
At this moment, Girl was born anew. This is fine.<br />
Name will be chosen from now on, memories will be created from this point on. There was no particular inconvenience.</p>

<p>“However, I shall not force you.”<br />
“I see. Then don’t worry about it.”<br />
“Understood. Well, then, we shall not worry about it,” Lady quickly yields to​ the Girl. “Instead, pray let me perform a regular health check. Just in case.”<br />
“Alright. Will you be gentle, please?”<br />
“Yes. I shall be careful.”</p>

<p>After that, silence fell for a brief moment, while they stared at each other.</p>

<p>“Err,” Girl says apologetically: “are we going to do it right now?”<br />
“No. I am in no hurry.”<br />
“Is that how it is.”<br />
“Yes, so it is. I have plenty of time.”<br />
“If you have a time, then could you describe me mine appearance?”<br />
“All right. By eye, you are half Caucasian and half Mongoloid race, I perceive. Skin is so much white, it reminiscent me the snow-scape.”<br />
“Snow-scape?”</p>

<p>Although Girl is aware of the snow, she could not imagine its appearance.</p>

<p>“‘Beauteous’ is what I am trying to convey.”</p>

<p>Complimented by Lady, Girl’s cheeks dyed red.</p>

<p>“I shall continue,” says the Lady. “Your height is approximately fifty-two and one hundred  centimetres. Body weight is about nine and thirty kilogram. Albeit it is below average, for you have just awakened from suspended animation, I believe it is possible to assert as healthy.”<br />
“Wait a moment.”<br />
“All right.”<br />
“How are you able to figure out my weight just by eye measurement?”<br />
“Ah-,”  Lady nods.<br />
“That is for I was holding you in my arms,”—Lady showed gesture of holding luggage in both arms—”when I carried you here.”<br />
“Is that so,” Girl nods. “Where did you bring me from?”<br />
“It was about forty-four kilometres due north from here. I rescued you, as you lost your consciousness.”<br />
“And what happened forty-four kilometres away from here?”</p>

<p>Girl is aware of kilometre unit. She is unaware of concrete values, yet believed it is a long distance.</p>

<p>“To me? Or to you?”<br />
“To both.”<br />
“You have lost your consciousness.”<br />
“I heard that just now. Why did I faint?”<br />
“I reached the conclusion that you was debilitated, for after waking up from suspended animation you moved around without nutrition. Given that I have provided necessary treatment, right now you are not in weakened state.”<br />
“I see. Thank you for your help.”<br />
“Ethics subroutine functions normally. That was natural of me to help you.”<br />
“Hmm,” the Girl asks: “then what were you doing there?”<br />
“Exploration. I am successively exploring the surface hereabout. I see what new I might discover.”<br />
“Something like myself?”<br />
“Indeed. This was the first time I have ran across a life-form other than myself since I began exploring.”<br />
“There is no other life-forms?”<br />
“Not within radius of forty kilometres. If I would explore further, I might encounter a life-form again. However, I doubt there are many.”<br />
“Why so?”<br />
“Because the world was destroyed.”<br />
“Destroyed, why?”<br />
“I do not know. I am LM series… Abbreviation for Library Management series.”<br />
“Uh-huh,” Girl listened.<br />
“Hence, my occupation is to manage this library.”<br />
“Is this… a library?”</p>

<p>Girl looked around.<br />
Certainly it is: Numerous computer terminals are lined up, plenty bookcases may be found alongside.<br />
The scenery matched appearance of  general library which Girl had in her mind. However, she do not remember actually visiting one.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is an Underground Library. It was built so solid that it can also act as a shelter in case of emergency.”<br />
“Hmm.”<br />
“I shall continue then,” says the Lady. “Upon that day, I was cleaning up the library, as usual before opening hours. Having done that, an impact took a place, and  external power supply was cut off. For it had never been restored, I switched to private power generator, and, after that, when I confirmed the outside, the world was destroyed.”<br />
“Does that mean you are still using private power generator?”<br />
“Yes; I presume it shall endure for another twenty years. However, just in case, I am additionally working on a project of solar panels’ installation.”<br />
“Uwa.”<br />
“To conclude this, the reason why the world was perished remains unclear.”<br />
“I see. Well, it’s ruined, so it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>Girl shrugged her shoulders.<br />
For the Girl, world did not exist from the beginning. Whether it was perished or prospered, she remember nothing.<br />
Hence, it matter not which one it is now. There is no reason to grieve or rejoice.</p>

<p>“May I change the subject?” questioned Lady.<br />
“It’s okay. Change it as much as you like,” answers the Girl.<br />
“All right. Would you like to become friends with me?”</p>
