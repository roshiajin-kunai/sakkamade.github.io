    <p>Upon returning to underground library, Lydia enter the air shower together with Yuuyami.<!-- more --><br />
Air shower is the room where dirt and bacteria that stuck to clothes and body can be completely removed.<br />
Being that in order to become absolutely clean just a single minute is sufficient, before world’s collapse it was widely popularized in general households.<br />
Pushed out by trend, traditional​ bath  disappeared from ordinary houses.<br />
But, I’d like to reproduce the bath someday, wished Lydia. Ambience of bath, cleansing body with foam, seemed to be very fun.</p>

<p>“I’m exhausted–.”</p>

<p>Lydia leaned upon standing beside her Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Please take a rest for today.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami places left hand at Lydia’s head before dishevel her hair.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. You know, I really want be friends with Rapha.”<br />
“Yes. And?”<br />
“But, I guess it might be impossible.”<br />
“With the reason being that she keeps speaking unpleasant words?”<br />
“Right. I don’t really get Rapha. Actually, I had much more questions to ask her.”<br />
“I cannot help but understand. For Lydia, it was a first encounter with intelligent life-form, excepting me.”<br />
“Humans are tedious–.”</p>

<p>Lydia tightly embraced Yuuyami.<br />
Yuuyami not a bother at all. Albeit they having various disagreements, Yuuyami always thinking of Lydia. Since Lydia also aware about it, it’s aren’t unpleasant in a slightest.</p>

<p>“You might say humans are, however Rapha-san and Lydia appearing to be a new breed of human beings created by humankind. Only if we assume Rapha-san’s story complete truth.”<br />
“Then, new humans are tedious.”</p>

<p>Lydia buried her visage in Yuuyami’s bosom. It’s soft and exceedingly comfortable.<br />
Bosom of Yuuyami weren’t designed to be large, however have an absolutely beautiful lines.<br />
I wonder if my chest would become like this one day-, Lydia was looking forward at her future.</p>

<p>“As indicates expression <em>Ten persons, ten colours</em>, whether it’s archaic humans or the new breed they can hold a wide variety of opinions. Some of them may not suit you.”<br />
“I see- I’m glad  Yuuyami was the one to find me. Supposing Rapha educated me, I would probably reject Yuuyami either.”</p>

<p>Lydia felt nauseous upon  mere imagining it.<br />
Aah, I see, realises Lydia.<br />
What was unpleasant the most, repudiation of Yuuyami.<br />
Existence of Yuuyami, education of Yuuyami, important moments of Yuuyami and Lydia. Rapha refused to accept these altogether.</p>

<p>“I also believe so. Rapha-san clearly repudiated my existence. Appearing to believe inside AD cannot dwell mental consciousness from the bottom of her heart. However that is due to her ignorance. Moreover—”</p>

<p>Yuuyami tightly​ hugs Lydia and caresses her back.</p>

<p>“—even if Rapha-san educated Lydia, she would definitely understand me one day. Would have acknowledged my existence. So it appears to me to be.”<br />
“Um, I hope you are right.”</p>

<p>Silence. Is it a time, or just the atmosphere​ that comfortably stream by?<br />
Albeit air shower being over by now, neither of them moved.</p>

<p>“Hey, Yuuyami,” said Lydia.<br />
“Yes. What is it?” Asked Yuuyami, as ever indifferently.<br />
“I love you.”<br />
“Me also, I love Lydia.”</p>

<p>Lydia knew Yuuyami would say so.<br />
Certainly knew.<br />
Despite that,<br />
although without understanding a reason,<br />
she felt as though her heart was bouncing.<br />
She experienced it being pounding before.<br />
What was that?<br />
I don’t understand.<br />
Even not understanding, it feels awfully​ comfortable.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Director’s office of an underground research facility Rapha using as her own room.<br />
Returning back to her room, bright illumination and thin sky-blue​ carpet welcomed Rapha.<br />
Her favourite fluffy white bed installed on the left side from entrance.<br />
Whereas on the right side simple table and chair. Upon the table, monoblock computer.<br />
Previously sofa and office desk were placed in the room, however Ohan had  them removed. Since it didn’t suite Rapha’s tastes.</p>

<p>“Now, onee-chama’s matter, what was I said that made her feel unpleasant, huh.”</p>

<p>Rapha sits down upon the bed and begins to ponder.<br />
Firstly, inside of her head, Rapha recreated conversation with Lydia. She confident to remember every single word without a mistake.<br />
After entirely replaying from Lydia’s first utterance to the very last, Rapha sighed a little.</p>

<p>“I. Was saying everything completely proper.”</p>

<p>Right. Nothing’s wrong. Rapha is right. At least Rapha believes so from the bottom of her heart.<br />
A sole blemish was when she grew flustered and turned over the chair.<br />
Be constantly graceful. That’s creed of Rapha. Terrible blunder to knock chair over.<br />
However it has no relations with Lydia’s subject.<br />
Setting aside the chair case, Rapha concluded: “I should be careful in future.”</p>

<p>“If she disagreed with righteous behaviour, onee-chama isn’t righteous person, as simple as that.”</p>

<p>But it’s unavoidable, judging Rapha.<br />
Lydia has no recollections. Accordingly, she learned certain novel incorrect information elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Good grief, why did onee-chama woke earlier?”</p>

<p>Completely irregular.<br />
Lydia supposed to awake together with Rapha.<br />
Notwithstanding that, upon the time when Rapha woke up, she was alone.<br />
Although she wanted to cry, she didn’t. Because to cry isn’t graceful.<br />
Instead, she performed exhaustive examination of the pod for artificial hibernation. However no error could be found, thus Rapha stopped blaming pod as the cause.</p>

<p>“After all it’s remains unknown, huh–.”</p>

<p>Even with repetition of assumptions and verifications, answer as yet nowhere to be found.<br />
Lying down the bed, Rapha aimlessly stared at the ceiling.<br />
Naturally, answer aren’t written there. Neither the reason of Lydia awaking earlier nor as for why Lydia felt unpleasant upon her words.</p>

<p>“Likewise, I ought to give onee-chama correct knowledge. So she would realise I’m not saying anything wrong.”</p>

<p>No, Rapha slightly shook her head.<br />
That’s not it. What I should ponder about is at what words Lydia has reacted.<br />
Once again, in her head, Rapha recreated conversation with Lydia. This time not mere words but every single move of  Lydia.<br />
Thereupon, she noticed one thing.<br />
Lydia points her gaze at Yuuyami upon the troubling moment. Wishing for Yuuyami to find a solution. Instead of ordering, simply asks. Appearing as though a friend.</p>

<p>“Friends? With AD? Are you stupid?”</p>

<p>Despite numerous great strides?<br />
However regardless the amount of times she replayed her memory, Lydia seemed to put a trust upon Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“If onee-chama has no recollection, would that be possible I wonder? If so, it’s probable for the cause of onee-chama oddity to be in that Yuuyami… That can’t be, right-? Fundamentally, AD works only according the program.”</p>

<p>LM series, that Yuuyami, can’t possibly instil superfluous knowledge in humans.<br />
Because of that, it must have been another person. Who gave Lydia knowledge. Perhaps the one who rewrote Yuuyami’s program.<br />
Who made Yuuyami behave more humane.</p>

<p>“I wonder where is onee-chama’s base? Is underground library, remaining?”</p>

<p>For Yuuyami is operating, likelihood is sufficient.</p>

<p>“Ara,” Rapha interrupted her chain of thoughts. “Again I’m deviating from the main subject.”</p>

<p>Raised her body, Rapha stands up the bed.</p>

<p>“Well, I have a week, that’s okay to think it over slowly, right?”</p>

<p>Mumbling so, she left the room to drink her favourite <em>café au lait</em>.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Midnight.<br />
Yuuyami was sitting before the computer desk.<br />
Computer booted up, holographic keyboard projected.<br />
However Yuuyami aren’t moving a finger.<br />
After Lydia went to bed, Yuuyami investigated the Angel Project. However no records appeared to be left anywhere.<br />
Accordingly, she decides to speculate upon the reason as for why no documents remains. That’s why, at present, Yuuyami aren’t shifts her fingers nor looking at the display.<br />
Humanity had open access, when it comes to information. Having advanced technologies, living prosperous life, humans, escaped competitive society. Significance of hiding information was being lost.<br />
Thanks to various <em>Maker</em> technologies, which re-emerging molecular structures of  all sorts, any human could obtain any materials. The world without deficit. World where no one had to surpass or defeat.<br />
Number of crimes has decreased as well, what crossed out most of prisons.<br />
Therefore, when information were open to public, risk of criminal use was low. Consequently, anyone had access to information they wished.<br />
With sole exception however, information related to military.<br />
Despite it expected to be peaceful world with seldom​ hardship, for some reason humankind won’t let go the armed forces and weapons until the end.<br />
Yuuyami finds it strange. Maintaining unnecessary things, pointless weapons developing  that don’t expected to be  used.<br />
Military related latest technologies and programs were always concealed, whereas available to public a several years later.<br />
For Ohan is an AD of old generation, detailed specification  remains as records. For such reason Yuuyami was able to compare her abilities with Ohan.</p>

<p>“Was Angel Project under military authorities jurisdiction?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami inclined her head sideways to herself.<br />
Here’s a deadlock. She can’t advance any further unless learn full story from Rapha or obtain materials of Angel Project.<br />
Consequently, she must take another path.<br />
Yuuyami playback the action log and viewed it for a while.<br />
Whereafter marked Rapha’s words that seem to be important.</p>

<p>‘Onee-chama, didn’t you promise to create a new world with me?’</p>

<p>If that’s truth, can be denoted a pair of likelihoods.<br />
Lydia and Rapha were aware of world bound to be destroyed.<br />
Or she made such promise after its perishing.<br />
Knowing the time of two enter suspended animation, answer would come.<br />
Following mark:</p>

<p>‘In order to start over from scratch onee-chama erases the memory…’</p>

<p>In other words, Lydia herself erased her own memory.<br />
But why?<br />
Although some assumptions can be made, none of them definitive. Best to ask Rapha.</p>

<p>“Hey, Yuuyami!”</p>

<p>Upon abruptly audible  voice of Lydia, surprised Yuuyami returns back.</p>

<p>“Lydia? Woke up?”</p>

<p>Turning the chair, Yuuyami faced Lydia.<br />
Lydia’s pale amber​ pyjamas was being sloppy, as well as her hair, here and there it was sticking out. It is usual case upon Lydia awakening in the dead of night.<br />
Having so exceedingly​ cute appearance, Yuuyami consider herself blessed.</p>

<p>“I’m calling you for a while, you know?”<br />
“Is that so? I didn’t notice.”<br />
“Concentrated, right?”<br />
“Yes. So what happened?”<br />
“Um, listen, tomorrow,” Lydia launched a smile, as one of mischievous child. “Let’s go viewing​ the sea?”</p>

<p>Suddenly, she was informed of exploration point for tomorrow.</p>
