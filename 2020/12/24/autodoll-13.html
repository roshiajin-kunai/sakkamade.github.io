    <p>Yuuyami never dreams.<br />
Autodoll are not dream.<br />
Upon system abend, everything’s vanish.<br />
Bubbles as though.<br />
Fun days, happy moments, each and everything.<br />
However,<br />
consciousness of Yuuyami certainly was yet there.<br />
Yuuyami have no concept for where is ‘there’.<br />
Insubstantial, drifting, a very, very tiny consciousness that appeared from the darkness.</p>

<p>“Lydia…”</p>

<p>Was it whisper or thought, that is left unperceived.<br />
Nevertheless,  desire resides within, desire to see her.<br />
To pass an apology for the arms that nigh broke Lydia.<br />
Was dangerous in sooth. However, being capable of setting Lydia free mere few seconds afore the system shut down. The lone solace.</p>

<p>“Lydia…”</p>

<p>Murmured again Yuuyami. Or thought perhaps. Either be fine now.<br />
Painful,  incapable to validate condition of Lydia.<br />
Sorrowful,​  unable to hear Lydia’ voice.<br />
All alone within the darkness.<br />
As though a prison, considered Yuuyami.<br />
Yuuyami do not feel coldness. Coldness of the one that dies. Notwithstanding that, her heart is frosted.<br />
The hard fact​ of not having Lydia beside appear lethal to her.<br />
I shall vanish completely from this state, so be at peace, was her thought.</p>

<p>“Such is not advised.”</p>

<p>Uttered someone. As for identity of the speaker, it’s unfamiliar Yuuyami.<br />
Perhaps no one  have said anything in fact. She’s clueless.</p>

<p>“Thou art over the process of evolution. Ergo, thou hast to place trust upon thine beloved whereas await.”</p>

<p>Certain image collides against consciousness of Yuuyami.<br />
A sole flower floating under the darkness.<br />
Purple one, the flower Lydia often sees in her dreams.</p>

<p>“You are..?”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Following Rapha return to underground research facility, she laid Lydia on her bed.<br />
Whereafter had Ohan to transport Yuuyami in the laboratory, with intention to scan Yuuyami’s system.<br />
For Lydia asked to leave it unrepaired, she had no intention of trying to reboot it.<br />
Nevertheless, wished to learn the situation thorough.</p>

<p>“Amazing, Yuuyami’s quantum brain went down.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami the world prime Autodoll, designed by Rapha and Lydia. It shouldn’t abend easily.<br />
Scanning results were showed on a display.</p>

<p>“I see,” nods Rapha. “Information overload is cause of shutdown itself, huh.”</p>

<p>Made assertion of the data from display.</p>

<p>“What kind of information should have been input to cause abend? Enormous volume of information?”</p>

<p>The conjecture​ however miss the mark.<br />
Examining displayed data, Yuuyami having quite of space left in the storage.<br />
And can yet preserve so much data as one desired.</p>

<p>“Wah, so issue isn’t in quantity but a question of quality.”</p>

<p>Even so, how complex must’ve been signals that exceed throughput of Yuuyami? Rapha cannot even imagine.<br />
Simulation of the supernova explosion simple task for Yuuyami. Its specifications of such extent.<br />
Naturally, it would yield to computer specializes in the sphere.</p>

<p>“Ara?”</p>

<p>Ridiculous part can be seen within scan results.</p>

<p>“What does that mean?”</p>

<p>Rapha tilted her head.<br />
System of Yuuyami completely down.<br />
Notwithstanding that,<br />
in a minor area of quantum brain exists hitherto a signal.</p>

<p>“Wah, that can’t be. Some error, surely.”</p>

<p>For the second time Rapha scanned Yuuyami.<br />
However, the result was equal. Section of quantum brain was in operation.</p>

<p>“Wah, I can’t follow. Impossible. Scanner must having error.”</p>

<p>Even being confused, Rapha inspected scanner.<br />
Nevertheless, found no abnormality.<br />
If that is truth,</p>

<p>“This data is actual, the result is…”</p>

<p>Head ached, Rapha pressed her forehead with left hand.</p>

<p>“It’s absolutely like, Yuuyami dreams.”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>When Lydia woke up, she had a plenty of thoughts.<br />
She could grasp either who and had a conjecture​ as of where she was.<br />
She was feeling awfully calm.<br />
Whereas exhaling, Lydia rose her body; she clenched her hands and moved her feet, so in order to check herself condition.<br />
No problems can be spotted in particular. She able to properly move and properly think.<br />
Also, the clothes she was wearing. A pure white dress. With no frills—. Not very cute dress.<br />
Thereon such affirmation, Lydia begins to perceive the surroundings.<br />
Inside of not-so-spacious room, Lydia find herself over the white bed. At the opposite wall placed desk withal computer on it.<br />
Sky-blue carpet at the floor.<br />
And,</p>

<p>“Ohan…”</p>

<p>Upon glittering metal skeletal structure, located gem-esque vermilion visual sensor.<br />
BD series Type・Ohan was squatting inside the room. Had both knees up, as though a child. The appearance was somewhat surreal.</p>

<p>“Lucy-sama, woke up, sleep well?”</p>

<p>Said Ohan, having no hint of intonation.</p>

<p>“Lucy you say, that’s to me?”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
“It’s different.”<br />
“Different?”</p>

<p>Without tilting a head, Ohan simply looked straight at Lydia.</p>

<p>“I’m Lydia.”<br />
“…You are Lucy-sama.”<br />
“I told you it’s different. I’m Lydia.”<br />
“…Did you, changed a name?”<br />
“I’m Lydia from the beginning. But, in case of​ Ohan talking about older days, then I don’t know.”<br />
“What you do not know?”<br />
“Er, what I called myself before the world collapsed, I don’t remember.”<br />
“You called yourself Lucifer.”<br />
“That’s the name of famous angel, isn’t it? Er, did I rebel against the God and turned a fallen angel?”<br />
“Not in the database.”<br />
“I see.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami would give me the answer I wishing for right away, judged Lydia.<br />
However Yuuyami is shut down.<br />
If Rapha listened Lydia obediently, at present Yuuyami should not be rebooted yet.</p>

<p>“I slept fine. Would you take me to Yuuyami?”<br />
“Subject leap.”<br />
“Er, firstly you asked how I’ve slept, right? I haven’t answered back then. And now I wanted to meet Yuuyami.”</p>

<p>Whereafter finally reboot Yuuyami. She was powerless at beach, however so long as equipment nearby she confident to recover Yuuyami.<br />
For that reason Lydia is calm.<br />
Without losing composure, calmly inspect system of Yuuyami afore thoroughly repair it. Thus, without damaging Yuuyami’s root— Yuuyami consciousness in a slightest.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami… Would it be black-haired AD?”<br />
“That’s right. LM series, type Ⅱ.”<br />
“The type is not in the database.”<br />
“I see. Is it because Yuuyami newer? Well, let’s go to black-haired AD.  Her hair so beautiful as the night, isn’t it?”<br />
“Do not understand.”<br />
“Umm…”</p>

<p>Conversation aren’t going well.<br />
Later with Rapha’s approval I need to update Ohan’s database, decided Lydia.<br />
Of course, being Ohan also had already pre-installed self-learning function; amount of data increasing so long as he was operating.<br />
Nevertheless, she felt Ohan have no much of knowledge.</p>

<p>“Could it be Rapha aren’t chatting with Ohan-?”</p>

<p>Quietly murmured Lydia.</p>

<p>“Ojou-sama giving me orders, and I execute it.”</p>

<p>Appears he could hear.</p>

<p>“Is that so. Although I might die without chattering, Rapha seem to be different.”<br />
“Die? Lucy… Lydia-sama. Would you get injured? Do you need a medical treatment?”<br />
“No. It’s metaphor. I’m in good health.”</p>

<p>Lydia let out a sigh.</p>

<p>“Despite good health, you will die?”<br />
“I won’t die. Forget it. Please.”<br />
“Understood. Removing the action log…”<br />
“No, no!” In panic said Lydia. “You don’t have to remove the log!”</p>

<p>What an inflexible AD, thought Lydia.<br />
Was every unconscious AD similar to this one, or else Ohan is exceptional?</p>

<p>“Cancel removing of the action log.”<br />
“Uh-huh. That’s good,” Lydia sighed once again. “At any rate, take me to Yuuyami.”<br />
“Understood.”</p>

<p>Ohan stand up, ish, ceased at halfway however.<br />
Thereon  switched to kneeling state at once, and in such manner walked on his knees toward the door.<br />
Very comical movement technique. At first, Lydia couldn’t make any sense of it. She wondered if there was leg malfunction.<br />
However,<br />
upon following glance at the ceiling, Lydia understood origin of Ohan’s behaviour.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Since Ohan’s huge, your head would perforate the ceiling.”</p>

<p>High ceiling for Lydia, low for Ohan.</p>

<p>“Lydia-sama, please follow me.”<br />
“Alright.”</p>

<p>Lydia got out the bed, stood up as usual,​ and walked as usual.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Lydia’ mind was calm.<br />
Given that she maintain confidence of recover Yuuyami to the Yuuyami of same state as she was.<br />
Along with  knowledge, she have abilities. As long as​ she has required equipment, there is nothing she couldn’t do.<br />
She believed so, had no doubt.<br />
However,<br />
in the laboratory, upon words of Rapha, Lydia’ mind turned maelstrom of chaos.</p>

<p>“If you want reboot it, without initialisation quantum brain ​would ignite, onee-chama.”</p>
