    <p>Lydia and Rapha were drinking <em>café au lait</em>​ in the dining room; at that time Yuuyami came in.</p>

<p>“Welcome back,” greeted her Lydia.<br />
“Yes. I’m back,” Yuuyami sat in the chair.</p>

<p>Before four-person table, in front of Lydia was siting Rapha, whereas Yuuyami sat by Lydia’s left side.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let’s drink it and return to the library.”</p>

<p>Lydia dropped her gaze upon the cup with <em>café au lait</em>.</p>

<p>“Indeed. I am interested to see progress of Maker Factory likewise.”<br />
“Before you’ll go home, I have two subjects I’d like to narrate you.”<br />
“Ah, I wished to ask something Rapha either.”<br />
“If so, please go ahead, onee-chama.”<br />
“Um. Well, why are you calling me onee-chama, not onee-sama?”<br />
“Is that what you wanted to hear? It’s not a lead in?”</p>

<p>Frowned her eyebrows Rapha.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. That’s main question, though?”</p>

<p>Staring at Rapha, Lydia tilted her head.<br />
Rapha let out a deep sigh afore saying:</p>

<p>“It was a verbal slip up. You don’t remember, onee-chama, but I used to call you onee-sama, you know?”<br />
“Is that so?”<br />
“Yes, so it is. So, I called you <em>onee-chama</em> once by mistake, but I was told  you liked it and I need to continue calling you onee-chama.”<br />
“I see. Thank you. Well, then, please, Rapha’s topics.”</p>

<p>Upon understanding, Lydia smiled.</p>

<p>“The two subjects of mine.”<br />
“I heard that a short while ago.”<br />
“Nm…” Rapha launched a bitter sight at her. “Don’t interrupt me. That’s just a  preface.”<br />
“Okay–.”</p>

<p>Happily replied Lydia; Rapha sighed.</p>

<p>“The first one. The one regarding​ us.”<br />
“Is that about me and Rapha?”<br />
“Yes, that’s right. Onee-chama, please, be silent for a moment.”<br />
“Understood. I’ll keep my mouth as tight as shellfish.”</p>

<p>Lydia squeezed her lips with fingers of both hands.<br />
Whereafter, but I’ve never seen a real shellfish, she added in her heart.</p>

<p>“As I already said before, we are the new creation of human beings. So, I will narrate you the matters that you surely concerned about.”</p>

<p>Lydia nodded couple of times.</p>

<p>“First of all, our life span, it’s longer than of ordinary humans.”<br />
“Up to what exact span?”</p>

<p>Rapha’s words were snapped by Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Well, average life expectancy​ of human beings was around one hundred fifty years, our is twice longer; thus it’s about three hundred years.”<br />
“Three hundred years…”</p>

<p>Yuuyami cast her eyes down as she pondered over it.<br />
Each person might consider three hundred years as long or a short period.</p>

<p>“No more than that?”</p>

<p>Lydia concluded it is brief. That was insufficient for the world exploration together with Yuuyami.<br />
Until now, Lydia was never actually concerned about the number of years she would live.<br />
Accordingly, she grew a little nervous upon discovering her exact finale.</p>

<p>“For now, let’s say,” <em>hmm</em>, exhaled Rapha. “I’m still proceed my research, I can prolong​ it up to four or five hundred years.”<br />
“Rapha-san, please, allow me to assist, with your research.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami gazed at Rapha directly.<br />
At such request Rapha showed slightly surprised countenance; in an instant however, restored her usual look.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll pass the data to you. So, please, do it on your own. I don’t want to collaborate.”<br />
“Understood. Thank you very much. However, in case of you getting any progress, could you share it with me?”<br />
“If so, it’s a contest, Yuuyami.”<br />
“Contest?”<br />
“Yes, that’s right. The contest, which of us will achieve better result.”<br />
“Ha-…”<br />
“Do your best, Yuuyami.”</p>

<p>Lydia tapped Yuuyami’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Wah, how crafty! Onee-chama is forbidden to contribute her! Cheering​ is forbidden too!”<br />
“Eh, but, even though I wished to tell that to Rapha either–.”<br />
“I will allow you rooting for me.”<br />
“Ah, uh-huh. Do your best, Rapha.”<br />
“Yes, I will!”</p>

<p>In delight smiled Rapha.<br />
Desire​ to conquer Yuuyami; Lydia understands that feeling likewise.</p>

<p>“Due to discussion of the subject regarding reporting each others’ outcome has been settled, please let us move to the  second subject.”<br />
“There’s more to it, you know?”<br />
“Is that so? I shall apologise.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami mildly bowed her head.<br />
With light nod, Rapha continued.</p>

<p>“We are not able to grow any more.”<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>Puts her hands on the chest Lydia.</p>

<p>“Did you recognise it only now?”</p>

<p>Seeing Lydia’s movement, Rapha asked so.</p>

<p>“Oh no, I, haven’t thought about it, but–.”</p>

<p>Lydia height does not progressed in a long time. Apart from that no changes can be seen in her physique. However, she haven’t worried apropos it. Whereas she believed to grow greatly upon someday.</p>

<p>“<em>Oh no</em>?”</p>

<p>A little tilted her head Rapha.</p>

<p>“To think that my breasts wouldn’t grow-, I was rather shocked.”<br />
“Th, that’s right… W, well-, no need to worry. I’m investigating this problem too, okay?”</p>

<p>Rapha also looked down on her chest.<br />
Whereon was a precipitous cliff. However, Rapha ought to look that way,  judged Lydia.<br />
Nevertheless, she did not say it. Thereat a possibility of flying these words back at herself, boomerang as though.<br />
Rapha sent a glance at Yuuyami.<br />
However, Yuuyami does not say a thing.<br />
Brief silence.<br />
The air turns delicate. Impossible to describe it as comfortable. Still, doesn’t neither mean it was heavy.<br />
Lydia forced a wry smile; Rapha let out light sigh.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami,” says Rapha. “Do you need the data?”<br />
“Yes. Therein is no particular problem.”<br />
“It’s serious!” “Wah, it’s serious!”</p>

<p>Replies Lydia and Rapha, against Yuuyami’s remark, overlapped.</p>

<p>“However, for it is not concerning a life. Whereas life expectancy the subject directly connected to life span.”</p>

<p>Indifferently stated Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“AD cannot understand…” Rapha sent a look at Lydia. “I’m not making fun of Yuuyami, okay? I’ve always been respectful. It’s just insurmountable wall due to differences of species…”<br />
“I know.”</p>

<p>Interrupting Rapha’s words, Lydia  slightly shrugging her shoulders.<br />
Such was common for Lydia - having disagreements with Yuuyami. Moreover, she recognised Rapha treated Yuuyami as an intelligent life-form.<br />
Otherwise, the word <em>contest</em> wouldn’t appeared.</p>

<p>“So you don’t have to look at me like that?”<br />
“I, I’m not particularly looking at onee-chama.”<br />
“Is that so?”<br />
“So that is.”</p>

<p><em>Humph</em>, turned away Rapha.</p>

<p>“Um,” says Yuuyami. “My development also… No, my height does not changing, however is not particular issue, is it?”<br />
“It’s not about height.”<br />
“Then, what are we talking about?”<br />
“Try to guess.”<br />
“Hmm.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami revealed thoughtful gesture. Probably reviewing the action log.</p>

<p>“Indeed. Breasts, right. Lydia’s statement of being shocked that her chest will not enlarge, and since then subject was regarding the breasts, right?<br />
“…Yuuyami,” said Lydia wearing a wry smile. “If you guessed, you don’t have to utter, alright?”<br />
“Is that so? I shall remember.”<br />
“Please do. Incidentally, Rapha, is that topic continuing yet?”<br />
“No, it’s not. I’ll quickly move to the second one.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>Nodded Lydia.</p>

<p>“I’ll cut to straight to the gist, we have another little sister.”<br />
“Eh?”</p>

<p>Lydia shoot her eyes open.<br />
What  will I do if she would be same type as Rapha, wondered Lydia.<br />
Single complicated, mysterious, and troublesome little sister, was already fairly enough.</p>

<p>“Name is Michael. Onee-chama and I used to call her Mika. So, that  Mika, I think,  brought this world to such a state.”<br />
“Does that means, she destroyed the world?”</p>

<p>Asked Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Still, surely Mika was involved. Besides, onee-chama, possibly, may be a little implicated too.”<br />
“I, am?”</p>

<p>Lydia intertwined her arm with Yuuyami’s. Otherwise, felt as though she will collapse.<br />
She may have wrecked majority of lives. It is as yet upon a phase of mere possibilities, however Lydia grew very anxious.<br />
Lydia hold plenty of knowledge. Thereat, got a beloved partner. Accordingly, Lydia understands. Loved companion was within each of others’ soul.</p>

<p>“It will be alright,” says Yuuyami. “Present Lydia different person from the former​ Lydia.”<br />
“That’s right,” agreed Rapha. “Besides, I don’t know if onee-chama was actually involved. But, at the very least, onee-chama was aware world should be under such a condition. From that, you might have been involved a little, is only my guess.”<br />
“Yes, might be so.”</p>

<p>The answer to both, Yuuyami and Rapha.<br />
But withal, Lydia’s mind was not clear. It being somewhat gloomy, an overcast as though.</p>

<p>“Can I ask you for farther details?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami was indifferent as ever.</p>

<p>“Fine. But, I wasn’t on good terms with Mika too. So, it’s fragments of pieces of information.”<br />
“That is not a problem. Please.”<br />
“Onee-chama, are you alright? You don’t seem to look well.”<br />
“Uh-huh. I’m fine.”</p>

<p>So long as was holding on to Yuuyami’s arm.<br />
Rapha exhaled a little, whereupon began:</p>

<p>“Mika had no distinction between the right and wrong.”</p>
