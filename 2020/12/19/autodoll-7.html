    <p>Girl was enjoying afternoon teatime.<br />
Sitting upon a cheap chair under parasol, mere saucer occupies the table.<br />
Tea cup that supposed to be placed there as well, was now in her right hand.<!-- more --><br />
Girl elegantly spends her time, whereas viewing scenery of the fallen world.<br />
With the snow melt, that became her daily routine.<br />
Albeit weather as yet a little chilly, since she needs a time to simply drink a single cup of tea, it doesn’t really bothered.<br />
Behind the girl rises a military AD, Type・Ohan. It’s the truth, nothing but stands. In case of problem not taking a place, Ohan does not talk.<br />
However,</p>

<p>“Ojou-sama.”</p>

<p>Ohan uttered such word.<br />
Synthesized voice has not a trace of emotion. Neither warm nor cold. Mere flat inorganic voice.<br />
Even so, little girl considers it’s good enough. That doesn’t means she likes it however.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Girl asked without paying so much as a single glance behind.<br />
She don’t hold any special feeling toward Ohan, whatsoever.<br />
From the standpoint of little girl, Ohan just a tool. Same as teacup. Well, Ohan has a slightly further convenience than a teacup.<br />
Nevertheless, essence is similar. It goes not beyond created for humans property.<br />
Artificial skin unnecessary for AD. Same for its clothes. If velvet voice undesirable, kindness superfluous as well. All it need to listen instructions and execute them correctly.</p>

<p>“Intruder in the area.”<br />
“Details?”</p>

<p>Girl put tea cup on the table.</p>

<p>“Probability of being a motorcycle ninety-eight percent.”<br />
“Motorcycle, huh.”</p>

<p><em>Hmm</em>, girl hit her chin with left hand.</p>

<p>“On autopilot?”<br />
“Passengers. Affirmation of two people.”<br />
“So there are human beings.”</p>

<p>It might be <em>Single Wing</em> I had been impatiently waiting for, thought the girl.<br />
Hopefully that would be  so.</p>

<p>“Probability of it to be onee-chama?”<br />
“Implementation authentication by facial recognition… Authentication error due to distance.”<br />
“Useless, as ever, huh–.”<br />
“Beg your pardon.”<br />
“Would you please execute it again as they get closer?”<br />
“Understood.”</p>

<p>Girl was far away, motorcycle as yet seem to be mere dot.<br />
If passenger of motorcycle wouldn’t be person who she has been impatiently waiting for, it’s hopeless. Girl don’t need friends. However, that would be fine if <em>Single Wing</em> will return.<br />
Girl reaches for her teacup again, sipping the tea.<br />
Be relaxed, patient, and constantly gracefulー that is her creed.<br />
Whereas, after letting to pass a short while,</p>

<p>“Authentication by facial recognition completed,” said Ohan.<br />
“Yes. So?”<br />
“Probability of being Lucy-sama ninety-nine percent.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing result, girl formed a slight smile.</p>

<p>“You’re finally back, onee-chama.”</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>Got off the bike, Lydia greeted peach haired girl.<br />
Yuuyami also got off the motorcycle, whereas fixing her gaze upon military AD Ohan.<br />
Ohan looked at bright red visual sensor of Yuuyami. At extremely indifferent, and even afraid gaze.<br />
Afraid? Me? Yuuyami was surprised at her own emotions. That goes without saying when she haven’t had awareness; although even after conscious came to dwell within her, she have never experienced the feeling up until now.<br />
Yuuyami grew a little perplexed​ upon running across the feeling of fear for the first time.<br />
However, Ohan does not show any further reaction. No warning, he does not shift a finger.<br />
Nearly three meters high Ohan, standing as though a wooden doll.<br />
Being the way it is, currently fear appears unnecessary, Yuuyami calms herself down.<br />
Supposing I was human, my pulse rate would rise and I would sweat, Yuuyami drew such assess.</p>

<p>“Welcome home, onee-chama.”</p>

<p>Girl places teacup and looks at Lydia, letting a smile show upon the face.<br />
According to eye measurements made by Yuuyami, age of the girl between ten and twelve years old. As individual, she slightly younger than Lydia.<br />
As for her race, she consimilar to Lydia, half Mongoloid and half Caucasian. Slender lines, mild underweight can be spotted. Her health however doesn’t seem to be poor.<br />
Green, big eyes are round and cute.</p>

<p>“This clothes, it’s cute!” Stated Lydia.</p>

<p>Girl clothing a black Gothic Lolita dress. With but a chest area being  white. Fair amount of decorative frills slightly fluttering, noticed Yuuyami.<br />
Whereas grew happy, imagining how would it suit Lydia as well.<br />
Without being immersed in her happiness however, Yuuyami keeps observing​ the girl.<br />
Little girl wears black tights decorated with tiny black ribbons upon her ankles.<br />
Below ankles black Rubber Soles.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br />
Basically, girl favour of black, concluded Yuuyami.<br />
However brighter colours would look better with peach hair of hers, drew such conclusion as well.<br />
Still, Yuuyami aren’t so boorish as to utter the opinions one by one.</p>

<p>“onee-chama’s clothes not very cute, huh?”</p>

<p>Lydia clothes designed by Yuuyami.<br />
Perhaps I may have no taste, Yuuyami drops her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Although not cute, it’s stylish, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Lydia tilted her head.<br />
Upon these words, Yuuyami restores dropped shoulders back to its original state. If Lydia pleased, that’s great.</p>

<p>“It is. Not bad.”</p>

<p>Saying that, girl pointed her gaze at Ohan.</p>

<p>“Can I ask the stool for onee-chama?”<br />
“Roger.”</p>

<p>Ohan has dull synthesized voice. Not a shred of emotion can be found. Albeit Ohan designed for military, so velvet voice unnecessary.<br />
For Yuuyami is LM series, serving a customers also included in her work. Accordingly, she embedded with pleasant velvet voice.<br />
Ohan rotated upon heels before moves precisely for five steps.<br />
With that, unhurriedly headed to basement down the stairs.<br />
If they had an underground facility, likelihood of Lydia is resided here as well seemed to be plausible. Location is quite near the spot where Lydia was picked up.<br />
<em>Whew</em>, Ohan came out of sight, Yuuyami took a breather.<br />
Fear has already gone, however she can’t reach peace of mind with military AD nearby.</p>

<p>“Hey-hey, why do you call me <em>onee-chama</em>?”</p>

<p>Lydia asked, whereas friendly grinning.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>“Only because onee-chama is onee-chama. But, onee-chama doesn’t remember.”<br />
“You aware of Lydia having no recollection?”</p>

<p>As expected, Lydia was here. As well as she has a certain relationship with this girl.</p>

<p>“Ara, is this one of peculiarity with your AD, interrupt while others  talking?” Girl tilted her head. “Usually, AD don’t interrupt human conversation. I wonder if onee-chama rewrote it?”<br />
“Nicely grasped, Yuuyami is AD! At first I couldn’t really differentiate myself of Yuuyami!”<br />
“I know it,” girl slightly shrugged her shoulders. “The latest generation AD, LM series type Ⅱ, am I right? I often had to have  such expensive AD. Actually, I think the only one deployed in underground library was in operation… this Yuuyami? Was it?”<br />
“Yes. I am.”</p>

<p>At Yuuyami reply, girl shows slightly sullen expression.</p>

<p>“I’m chatting with onee-chama.”<br />
“Is that so? I’m sincerely apologise.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami lowers her head. It is  rather refinement​ movement. Ten people out of ten would expressed their gratitude for it being so lovely.<br />
Yuuyami knew such action and implement it.</p>

<p>“The movement is so perfect, you can fall in love with it,” said the girl to express her admiration. “As expected, being designed by me and onee-chama.”<br />
“My design?”</p>

<p>Slightly inclining her head, Lydia cast a gaze upon Yuuyami.<br />
Yuuyami immediately executes search through the database for her designer.</p>

<p>“The designer’s name is… I believe it’s masculine name.”</p>

<p>The hit name wasn’t a feminine name, regardless of how you would read it.</p>

<p>“That one incompetent, right? Ones who actually designed it was only me and onee-chama, that fellow was just self-importantly giving instructions.”</p>

<p><em>Good grief</em>, girl shook her head.</p>

<p>“Did we really create Yuuyami?”<br />
“That’s right.”<br />
“Waah, former me was amazing-!”</p>

<p>Lydia clapped her hands in delight.<br />
The girl, who I coincidentally rescued, was my birth parent—Yuuyami was being deeply moved.<br />
Perhaps no coincidences in this world, everything might have been inevitable, considered Yuuyami. Can be rephrased as <em>destiny</em>.<br />
My encounter with Lydia was fateful, wasn’t it?<br />
Yuuyami filled with urge to share a hug, during jumping up and down, with Lydia, however she suppressed her feelings for the time being.<br />
She has to ask the girl.</p>

<p>“You a… No, not you, Lydia; present name of the girl you keep calling onee-chama is <em>Lydia</em>.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami sent a short glance at Lydia, but immediately returns her eyes back to the girl.</p>

<p>“I’m Lydia. Nice to meet you.”<br />
“…Lydia, huh–.”</p>

<p>Said girl, a little dissatisfied.<br />
Perhaps she didn’t pleased with the name, Yuuyami doesn’t brings it up however.</p>

<p>“Hence, the question is who are the other party?”</p>

<p>Asked Yuuyami, girl smiles a little.</p>

<p>“At first, I am Raphael. onee-chama used to call me Rapha.”<br />
“Is that so,” says Lydia. “Can I call you Rapha again?”<br />
“Yes, naturally.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami performed a search for the name <em>Raphael</em>, however results which would seem to have relation to the girl weren’t found.</p>

<p>“Hey, Rapha, are we sisters?”<br />
“There is no blood connection. For that reason we can even get married.”</p>

<p><em>Marriage</em>, something inside of Yuuyami reacted at the word. She doesn’t understand what exactly reacted. Albeit she doesn’t understand, it’s exceedingly​ unpleasant feeling.<br />
What sort of emotion was that?<br />
Even  reckoning upon it for a short while, she was clueless.</p>

<p>“So that’s how it is. I’m not going to marry Rapha though.”</p>

<p>Upon Lydia showing a clear refusal, unpleasant feeling, that born inside Yuuyami, disappears.<br />
Being that a true nature of emotion remained indistinct, Yuuyami grew a shred of disappointment.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s how it is,” girl a little shrugged her shoulders. “We are the product of Angel Project. onee-chama is <em>Hatsu Ten</em>, me <em>Ni Tenmoku</em>.”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><br />
“What is Angel Project?”</p>

<p>Asks Lydia, having a keen interest.</p>

<p>“Well, to put it simply, it’s the project of creating humans from nought. Naturally not just humans, its objective creation of outstanding, novel human beings.”</p>
