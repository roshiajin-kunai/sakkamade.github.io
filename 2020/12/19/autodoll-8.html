    <p>“Amazing-!”</p>

<p>Lydia clapped hands to emphasize her excitement.</p>

<p>“Human beings can be created without sexual intercourse!?”</p>

<p>Hearing though the outline of Angel Project, she shared her meek impression. <!-- more --><br />
Being that Lydia received a sex education as well, she has good understanding of the process leading to humans birth.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama…” Rapha cheeks dyed. “So loud… how improper.”<br />
“Improper? Why?”</p>

<p>Lydia slightly bent her neck.</p>

<p>“Mn… that’s, that…”</p>

<p>Growing at loss of words, Rapha switched her gaze upon teacup.<br />
Albeit that appeared unlikely to have a chat​ with it, Lydia also looked at the teacup.<br />
However as before, teacup keeps being silent.<br />
Well, that’s right, thought Lydia, thus shifts her sight at Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Hey, Yuuyami, why is it improper? Humans producing new humans, why improper? It’s wonderful to create something, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami holds plenty of knowledge. Therefore Lydia knew if she ask Yuuyami comprehension of mostly everything could be achieved.<br />
Naturally there are things which even Yuuyami didn’t understand.<br />
For instance, the reason of world’s downfall.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” indifferently begins Yuuyami. “Essentially it is truly a  wonderful thing. However being that frequently numerous humans were having sexual act for the sake of pleasure…”<br />
“The objective was changed?”<br />
“Right. Indeed. Inasmuch as excessively typical advantage for sexual activity was to satisfy lust, that considered as improper— unrefined, shameful.”<br />
“So that’s why.”<br />
“So it is.”</p>

<p>Lydia deeply nodded, Yuuyami nodded slightly.</p>

<p>“Not only that. Humans have objects they are shy of. AD doesn’t possess it however.” Rapha glanced at Yuuyami: “Is that the act of displaying nudity to the other person?”<br />
“Correct.”</p>

<p>Whereas recalling several movies used for sex education, Lydia nodded.</p>

<p>“Wah, that’s how it is.”<br />
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Despite that, Lydia has no idea.<br />
Why did she said display nudity?<br />
Since Lydia loved clothes, she simply wears them, she didn’t thought she has to wear them separately.</p>

<p>“Maiden shouldn’t lightly expose her nudity, onee-chama.”<br />
“Even if there is no one in the world?”</p>

<p>Lydia slightly inclined her head sideways.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right. In addition, don’t say loudly things related to act. That’s how maiden ought to behave.”<br />
“Even if no one to hear?”<br />
“Yes, that’s right. You have no memory, onee-chama, so it’s may be unavoidable, however please be careful from now on?”<br />
“Um—m.”</p>

<p>Lydia not quite understands.</p>

<p>“Lydia,” says Yuuyami. “Rapha-san  asking you simply in view of the fact that it is makes her uncomfortable.”<br />
“Aah, I see.”</p>

<p><em>Clap</em>, Lydia hit her hands.<br />
If so, she cloud say this from the beginning. Since I hate sexual activity, let’s don’t speak about it.<br />
What a roundabout child, judged Lydia.<br />
At that time, Ohan came up the stairs with chair in right hand.<br />
Ohan seemed to be awfully large and strong, metal skeletal frames were sparkling. So cool, was Lydia’s impression.<br />
Furthermore, Ohan’s visual sensor resembled a vermilion gem, very beautiful.<br />
Ohan leisurely and confidently​ walked next to Lydia.<br />
Lydia raises her gaze, Ohan focuses sensor upon Lydia.<br />
When</p>

<p>“Here you go,” with that said, placed a chair.<br />
“Thank you,” answers Lydia.</p>

<p>However Ohan did not say “Not at all” or “I’m glad you pleased,” however simply, once again unhurriedly, moved behind Rapha. Thus, stopped operating right there.<br />
Doesn’t appears to be run out of energy, seems like there Ohan’s home position, guessed Lydia.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama, why are you doing something like showing a gratitude to AD?”</p>

<p>Rapha displayed a very puzzled facial expression.</p>

<p>“For bringing me chair.”</p>

<p>During answering, Lydia sat down upon the chair. Not too comfortable, however it’s better than standing all the while.</p>

<p>“That was because I ordered it,” stated Rapha with slightly sullen look. “So, if you wish to thank someone, why don’t you say it to me?”<br />
“Uh-huh. Thank you too, Rapha.”</p>

<p>Lydia sets afloat a smile, however Rapha remained sullen.</p>

<p>“Me, <em>too</em>?”<br />
“Uh-huh. Rapha asked…” Lydia shifts her sight at Ohan. “And because he brought. Er, I haven’t yet hear name, have I?”<br />
“It’s Type・Ohan.”</p>

<p>She aware of it. Yuuyami mentioned it when they were riding a motorcycle.</p>

<p>“It’s type, what about name?”<br />
“It has no name. I don’t have any particular attachment to it, there’s no point of appending a name. Well, I think it’s okay to attach one to AD that is so valuable as Yuuyami.”</p>

<p>Lydia felt slightly unpleasant upon Rapha’s phrasing.<br />
Wording as though Ohan has completely no value. However, Ohan carried her a chair. Also, the appearance is cool.<br />
He has plenty of value, reckoned Lydia.</p>

<p>“Listen, do you,” Lydia speaks to Ohan. “Wish to have a name?”<br />
“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>Ohan gave unconcerned  answer.</p>

<p>“Are you hold consciousness? Or else, nothing but cool?”</p>

<p>Lydia slightly tilted her head.</p>

<p>“Huuh?” Rapha distorts her visage. “Onee-chama, are you have a brain disorder? At occasion of erasing your memory, did you have a prognostic symptom?”<br />
“Eh? What do you mean?”<br />
“Apparently, otherwise you wouldn’t claim an AD conscious, unless you a greatly mad person.”</p>

<p>Being that in Yuuyami dwells consciousness, it wouldn’t be strange to be similar with Ohan, thought Lydia.<br />
Even if Ohan don’t possessed consciousness at the moment, there is always a possibility that he will, in the future.<br />
However she slightly hesitated as for whether to say it.<br />
Rapha’s repudiation was so strong, hence she felt a quarrel would be unavoidable.</p>

<p>“Well, from now on, I’ll educate onee-chama and bestow you a proper knowledge. So, it’s okay to be crazy for now.”</p>

<p>The gaze full of pity. Disdaining tone.<br />
Lydia felt immensely unpleasant.<br />
Lydia  already has been proved as full-fledged individual by Yuuyami. Rapha repudiate​s not merely Lydia, it’s equal to repudiation of education which she recieved from Yuuyami.<br />
It was a very, very unpleasant.</p>

<p>“I waited for onee-chama three months, you know? When I woke up, onee-chama wasn’t there for some reason. Even though we supposed to awake at the same time. In a moment, I became desperate.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Rapha began narration.<br />
Lydia was hearing Rapha more or less, however her heart longed for returning to library.<br />
Talking to Rapha, she grows somewhat tired, as well as it doesn’t feel nice.<br />
Long-awaited human she met— Moreover her sister, and yet, at present, she don’t feel a slightest bit of happiness.</p>

<p>“But I believed, I waited. Onee-chama surely will come back. When finally, today, you made it. Well now, onee-chama, let’s enjoy <em>la création du monde</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> with me.”</p>

<p>Rapha suddenly reached out her left hand.<br />
She wants her to take this hand. Lydia comprehend the meaning correctly, however did not touch it.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama, if I held out my hand, grip it. Naturally, please remove your gloves firstly.”</p>

<p><em>Good grief</em>, Rapha slightly shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’m going home now.”</p>

<p>Lydia stood up before turning upon her heels.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama!?”</p>

<p>The sound made Lydia realise,  Rapha turned over a chair, standing up in panic.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami, will you drive home?”<br />
“Yes. Of course.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami set afloat a smile.<br />
Voice of Yuuyami truly brings peace of mind.<br />
Neither disdaining nor compassionate, but sincerely tender.</p>

<p>“Please wait, onee-chama. What does that means?”<br />
“Regardless of your further words,” Lydia to sent a look over her shoulder. “Utmost I shall do is quietly return home.”<br />
“Have you forgot something? In that case I’ll send Ohan to collect it. Now, onee-chama, you don’t have to go anywhere, huh?”<br />
“I want to visit various sorts of places, though?”</p>

<p>Lydia launched a light smile.<br />
The world exploration together with Yuuyami.<br />
Even if there is nothing in the world, that’s fine.<br />
After all, in a world of nothingness, everything can be created from now on.<br />
There are numerous projects for Lydia and Yuuyami. Comprising plenty of creations.</p>

<p>“Wah, I don’t understand. Onee-chama, didn’t you promise to create a new world with me? In order to start over from scratch onee-chama erases the memory and then shall lead me, didn’t you say that?”<br />
“I didn’t, you know?”</p>

<p>That is truth. Present Lydia do not remember to make such promise.<br />
From Lydia standpoint, world begins together with awakening in the library. Nothing before that.</p>

<p>“Wah, you told me.”<br />
“Um—m, but perhaps, that’s, isn’t me?”<br />
“Wah, it doesn’t matter, because only onee-chama is onee-chama.”<br />
“Well, that’s,” Lydia smiles. “I want to be friends with Rapha. But I’m going home today, okay?”<br />
“Why?”<br />
“To put it bluntly, because Rapha says nothing but unpleasant things, in my opinion.”</p>

<p>At present, she wanted to leave Rapha.<br />
Lydia felt she would grew worn out at this rate.</p>

<p>“Unpleasant things..?” Rapha tilted head. “When was that?”</p>

<p>Earnestly, Rapha asked a question with widely opened eyes, as though being oblivious from the bottom of her heart.<br />
Lydia didn’t have an idea as for her further actions.<br />
Yuuyami, who always by my side, very logical, understanding my good and bad points, not a single time has she let to slip an unpleasant words upon me.<br />
For Lydia, Rapha appeared very sophisticated creature.</p>

<p>“Er, well, that’s will be Rapha’s project, to ponder about it, alright?”</p>

<p>Despite performing a makeshift, Lydia desired to somehow settle the conversation.</p>

<p>“Project?”<br />
“Yes. I’ll come back again, until then, okay?”<br />
“When is <em>until then</em>?”<br />
“Er, in a week, or something?”</p>

<p>Upon Lydia answer, Rapha displayed slightly thoughtful gesture.</p>

<p>“One week, was it? Wah, understood. I’ve been waiting for three months. I’ll wait for another week.”<br />
“During waiting, seriously think it over, okay?”</p>

<p>Upon the next meeting, Lydia wished not to be so exhausted.</p>

<p>“Wah, naturally. I have an excellent ability of completing projects.”</p>

<p>Declared Rapha, puffing out her chest, but, for some reason, Lydia had not been worried too much of it.</p>
