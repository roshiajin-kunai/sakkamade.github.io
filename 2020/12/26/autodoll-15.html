    <p>Lydia plugged a Lightning Blade in the port upon right wrist of Yuuyami.<br />
The fastest wired interface created by humankind, how can be described Lightning Blade.<br />
As regarding wired information transmission exists no faster device than this. In prior of world’s collapse, was claimed that it should maintain top position for the following one hundred years.<br />
Via such Lightning Blade were connected Yuuyami and Ohan.<br />
Yuuyami’s right wrist to Ohan’s port on the left shoulder.</p>

<p>“This one is ready.”</p>

<p>Lydia sent a gaze towards Rapha.</p>

<p>“Here is also arranged.”</p>

<p>Rapha set up two computers.<br />
Upon slight nod, Lydia  inserted Lightning Blade into Yuuyami’s left wrist as well.<br />
This one linked with Rapha’s computer.</p>

<p>“Ohan.”</p>

<p>Said Rapha, whereafter Ohan inserts Lightning Blade into his right shoulder port.<br />
Two computers, Yuuyami, and Ohan now were connected.<br />
<em>Ta-ta</em>, Lydia sprinted to computer afore sat in front of it. The computer which was directly connected to Yuuyami, on the right side of Rapha.</p>

<p>“Speaking of which, onee-chama.”<br />
“Mm?”<br />
“I at last found the answer for project onee-chama assigned to me.”<br />
“Project?”<br />
“…Onee-chama, did you, forget, by any chance…”</p>

<p>In a twinkle, Rapha distorted her face, giving off a feeling being nigh crying.</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember.”</p>

<p>Remembered just now, to be exact.</p>

<p>“Wah, I’m glad.”</p>

<p>Rapha calmed her expression.</p>

<p>“And, why so suddenly?”<br />
“Wah, it’s not sudden. I was waiting for right timing.”<br />
“Is that so.”<br />
“Yes, that is. After I stopped crying, aren’t we were thinking out the way to save Yuuyami?”</p>

<p>Yes. Within over an hour Lydia and Rapha were pondering before arriving to sole possibility.<br />
If Yuuyami cannot handle the task alone, they should divide the load elsewhere.<br />
To Ohan, for instance.<br />
Albeit being inferior in performance to Yuuyami, Ohan still has a quantum brain. Hence shouldn’t be problems leaving the processing to Ohan for about thirty percent.</p>

<p>“Then, as soon as method was decided, we began preparations, aren’t we? For this reason I couldn’t say it earlier.”<br />
“Is that so. And what’s the answer?”<br />
“Until today, I expect the issue to be when I asked you take off a glove.”<br />
“Glove?”<br />
“Yes, a glove. Onee-chama was riding motorcycle, so you must have felt colder than I did. Despite that, when I wanted handshake, I asked you to remove a glove, right?”</p>

<p>Lydia was being silent.<br />
Apropos, I feel as if such an exchange truly took a place. However, such occurrence haven’t found a spot in the mind to remain.<br />
Thus, after a week of reasoning, the answer she gave is <em>a glove</em>; upon such realisation, as one would expect, Lydia turned speechless.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it was wrong. The correct answer, because every single word I said to Yuuyami was rude, am I wrong?”<br />
“Correct.”<br />
“So, before Yuuyami wake up, that…”</p>

<p>Rapha cast her eyes downward, her body was caught by fidgety tremor.</p>

<p>“What is it?”<br />
“That’s, why, I, be, be.”<br />
“You <em>be</em>? You <em>be</em> what?”<br />
“I be, I beg your, pardon…”</p>

<p>Upon hearing these words Lydia widened her eyes.<br />
Rapha, apologised. I didn’t consider Rapha as the type who would meekly express a regret; Lydia was astonished.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s fine, totally fine. If you understand, that’s fine with me. Besides, I should apologise for calling you ignorant and foolish. I’ll correct myself. Rapha’s wise, and is not stupid.”<br />
“Naturally.”</p>

<p>Said prim Rapha.<br />
After all Rapha is complicated, reached conclusion Lydia.<br />
She alter her attitude so lightly that is hard to grasp.<br />
Whereas Yuuyami usually monotonous, she very easy to understand.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let’s get started,” says Lydia.<br />
“Yes. It’s very enjoyable for me to work together with onee-chama.”</p>

<p>Rapha smiled slightly before turning to the display.<br />
Lydia typed Yuuyami reboot code, and utilise it.<br />
Thereat,</p>

<p>“Aaaah-aah-aahh!”</p>

<p>Yuuyami raised a beast-esque voice.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>This again, thought Yuuyami.<br />
Unprocessable emotional runaway.<br />
It was sophisticated, mysterious, and inconsistent, whereas ate up  the resources of Yuuyami entirely.<br />
However, at present appeared a little easier than  previous time.<br />
As an evidence, Yuuyami was able to completely​ recognise her circumstances.<br />
Ports upon both of my wrists opened, Lightning Blade is connected. One  linked with computer, whilst the other to another quantum brain.<br />
Ah-, so that is why?<br />
Yuuyami understood the reason as for its easiness.<br />
Distinct quantum brain facilitated the processing.<br />
Then, perhaps, that was Lydia, the one who came up with this idea.<br />
Lydia trying to help me; at moment of such thought passed through her mind, quantum brain was nigh to inflame.</p>

<p>“Lydia…”</p>

<p>Name was said inadvertently.<br />
Upon thinking of Lydia, emotions have enlarged.<br />
I know. I found the origin of this emotion last time, in prior of the shut down.<br />
Consequently, as a matter of course, I am receiving  proper reaction upon thinking of Lydia.<br />
I,<br />
love,<br />
Lydia.<br />
Hence, this is a simple subject.<br />
Yuuyami seemed on a verge of breaking from love.<br />
Her love was too heavy, and was gnawing​ her.<br />
How humans able to rule such an emotion filled with contradictions, wondered Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama! Wah, Ohan’s quantum brain cannot endure it!”</p>

<p>Voice of Rapha.<br />
I see, reasoned Yuuyami.<br />
Lydia appealed Rapha for assistance, whereas Ohan is in charge of handling processing for Yuuyami.<br />
I have to control it somehow, she thought.<br />
But withal, emotions endlessly rampant.<br />
Tried ran beyond the edge of universe.<br />
In this universe, no one loves Lydia so much as I do. Considering this intense love to such degree.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama! I’m begging you! Please remove Yuuyami! Wah, Ohan will brake!”</p>

<p>I do not wish to destroy Ohan, thought Yuuyami.<br />
Do not wish to hurt Rapha likewise.<br />
Nevertheless,<br />
she cannot bring herself to shut down.<br />
Cannot allow emotions to vanish. Cannot allow to lose love for Lydia.<br />
If I would abend this time, might never see Lydia again.<br />
Such dread keeps Yuuyami away from shutdown.<br />
However,<br />
either way,<br />
if nothing would be done, my quantum brain bound to ignite.<br />
Is that how the one being swallowed by fear.</p>

<p>“Lydia…”</p>

<p>Muster everything to.<br />
Praying, desiring to.</p>

<p>“Plea, se, remove”</p>

<p>me, if you can.<br />
Hoping to see you again.<br />
If quantum brain burn, Yuuyami will no longer. And definitely never see Lydia.<br />
If I shut down however, therein at least a chance.<br />
Albeit​ being awfully scared. Truly scared.<br />
Because I have a faith in you.<br />
Because even if I shall remain all alone in the darkness,<br />
I can imagine your appearance.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Lydia typed in a command to shut Yuuyami down.<br />
Whereupon, burst into tears.<br />
She couldn’t rescue Yuuyami. That was the only way.<br />
Sole method has failed.<br />
No hope can be seen. She doesn’t know how to help Yuuyami.<br />
Perhaps, solution would be to combine more quantum brains?<br />
Certainly no.<br />
Lydia was convinced.<br />
Since it gnawing even Yuuyami, she believed that wasn’t a kind of information which can processed a quantum brain in the first place.<br />
Otherwise, hope in such  strategy should be seen afore.<br />
How odd, Ohan was about to break so easily.<br />
No, more specifically, at the point when it couldn’t be processed by Yuuyami, it cannot  be an ordinary information.<br />
Accordingly, upon increasing quantity of quantum brains, result will remain constant.<br />
She makes a mistake within something rather basic.<br />
Or overlooks, perhaps.<br />
However where was a mistake or what has been overlooked, she has no idea.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama…”</p>

<p>Rapha touched Lydia’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“It’s okay, it’ll be okay…”</p>

<p>Lydia wiped tears. She can’t resign. Cannot lose Yuuyami.<br />
She have to give it a thought. Farther think it over.<br />
Upon that moment, Ohan, on his knees, approached Lydia.</p>

<p>“Ohan..?”</p>

<p>Lydia tilts her head.</p>

<p>“Okay. Ohan’s already back to normal.”</p>

<p>Said Rapha during looking at display.</p>

<p>“Lydia-sama.”</p>

<p>Ohan reached out and grasped Lydia’s head.<br />
It doesn’t hurt. Rather, a very gentle motion.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Ohan?”<br />
“I love you.”</p>

<p>With that said, Ohan pulls Lydia’s face to himself.<br />
At such distance seemed as though their faces likely to collide.<br />
Up close, Ohan was yet so sparkling and cool as always.</p>

<p>“What is this piece of junk talking about?</p>

<p>Rapha struck Ohan’s arm with her right hand.<br />
Whereafter, her eyes grew teary, “It hurts…”<br />
She doesn’t have to be so surprised after doing something like striking a metal skeletal frames. Accordingly, Lydia ignored the occurrence.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Ohan,” says Lydia. “But what happened so suddenly?”<br />
“Yuuyami, Yuuyami, this is, Yuuyami’s, data.”<br />
“Eh?”<br />
“Yuuyami, wanted Lydia-sama’s—” Ohan pressed a finger of right hand at Lydia’s lips. “—lips—wanted to put her lips on Lydia-sama’s.”<br />
“Lips.., kiss..?”</p>

<p>Upon that instant, everything became clear.<br />
Each and everything grew a single road.<br />
Whereat each of street lights were shining brightly, illuminating a path before her.<br />
This sort of feeling.<br />
In prior Yuuyami’s shut down, Lydia kissed Yuuyami.<br />
I loved Yuuyami, and couldn’t help it.</p>

<p>“I see. Yuuyami also wished to kiss me.”<br />
“Wh, what do you mean? Yuuyami, doesn’t S, S, SA series, you know?”<br />
“I know. Yuuyami, loves me, wishes to kiss me, however couldn’t handle that emotion— that urge.”<br />
“Emotion?”<br />
“You don’t have to believe, but I’m confident. It was emotion that evoke such an impulse and made Yuuyami behave odd.”<br />
“No, I, believe, but, if so…”<br />
“Uh-huh. There is no workaround.”</p>

<p>Namely a problem.<br />
Lydia’s prediction was correct,  in itself.<br />
The emotion cannot be processed by quantum brain.<br />
It is the most troublesome, most inconsistent, and most destroyable emotion of humanity.<br />
Even humans who have lived for many years were being swayed by such emotion and, occasionally, resigned their lives.<br />
Yuuyami, who was yet discovering various emotions, surely bears a lot.<br />
No wonder​ she shut down.</p>

<p>“Wh, what are you going to do?”<br />
“Mulling. However, let’s take a rest for today? It would be meaningless if our performance drops.”</p>

<p>Unlike Autodoll, humans could provide more efficiently upon taking a proper rest.</p>

<p>“Understood. Well, then,  we  can sleep together, onee-chama!”</p>

<p>In delight asked Rapha.</p>
