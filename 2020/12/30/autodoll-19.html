    <p>“That was! improper!”</p>

<p>Simultaneously as Lydia removed a device off her head, Rapha approached with such words.<br />
Lydia solidified, whereas sat down the bed.</p>

<p>“Even in a dream, that sort of actions…”</p>

<p>She lost her energy at midway, so Lydia could nOt hear the second half of sentence.</p>

<p>“What sort of actions?”</p>

<p>Upon Lydia question, Rapha’s face turned deep red, afore she cast her eyes downwards.<br />
Unintentionally letting out a short giggle, Lydia removed electrodes off her body.</p>

<p>“Say, what sort of actions?”</p>

<p>Whereafter, asked such once again.</p>

<p>“Th, th tha, that’s…”</p>

<p>Rapha stuttered.<br />
With following,</p>

<p>“O, onee-chama is so dissolute, waaaa!”</p>

<p>Rapha cried out, running towards entrance, and, just like that, collides  the door.</p>

<p>“It hurts, waaa!”</p>

<p>Whereupon Rapha shouted anew, opened the door, and only afterwards  left the room.</p>

<p>“How inelegant–.”</p>

<p>Shrugs her shoulders Lydia.<br />
Rapha always taught Lydia to splendour of gracefulness.<br />
Nevertheless, Rapha herself aren’t so elegant as she believes.</p>

<p>“Is that alright?”</p>

<p>Properly rebooted, Yuuyami walked to Lydia and stood before her.<br />
In right hand Yuuyami held her habitual maid outfit. The one Lydia had fore her prepared.</p>

<p>“What?”<br />
“Wouldn’t it better to chase after her?”<br />
“She’ll be alright. Rapha, perhaps, just chose to leave the two of us in private.”<br />
“Pardon?”</p>

<p>Yuuyami inclines her head sideward.</p>

<p>“Although Rapha complicated and ultra-troublesome child, she has no particular need to leave, I think.”<br />
“Ha–.”<br />
“Just my guess.”</p>

<p>Slightly widened her arms Lydia.<br />
Rapha being complicated and mysterious as ever. Speech and conduct​s were not always consist​ with the feelings of her heart. Hence, one should guess the actual intentions.<br />
Of course, provided that a guess was correct, therein no guarantee.</p>

<p>“At any rate, it’s been a long time.”</p>

<p><em>Bop, bop</em>, Lydia tapped bed. Gesturing to sit next to her.</p>

<p>“We met only a moment ago. Inside of the dream.”</p>

<p>Upon precise insight of  Lydia’s gesture, Yuuyami sat beside her.</p>

<p>“It’s been a while, in the world of reality.”<br />
“Your truth. It appears to me that I have been down for quite a long time.”<br />
“I missed you.”<br />
“Pray excuse me.”<br />
“It’s alright, after all Yuuyami was lonely either, weren’t you?”<br />
“Yes. Awfully.”<br />
“What was it like? Quantum brain of Yuuyami is—somewhat—operating. Did you knew that yourself?”<br />
“Yes. However, merest darkness resides therein.”<br />
“Darkness…”<br />
“Indeed. Withal, I have always been thinking of Lydia. Thus was able to endure it.”<br />
“I see.”</p>

<p>Moving closer, Lydia leaned on Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Incidentally, within that darkness I came across rather uncanny existence.”<br />
“Was it an iris flower?”</p>

<p>Asked Lydia; Yuuyami widely opened her eyes.</p>

<p>“How did you find out? Were you monitoring me?”<br />
“It’s different. I met them in my dream either. They are an intelligent life-form.”<br />
“Indeed. Certainly appeared to have intelligence.”<br />
“Though, as yet their identity remains foreign.”<br />
“If so, shall we ascertain them someday.”<br />
“Right.”</p>

<p>Silence.<br />
That is an exceedingly​ pleasant silence.<br />
Lydia’s heart was pounding as she touches Yuuyami in the physical world.<br />
Now, Lydia knew the meaning of that pounding.<br />
Hence she accepted it, whereas entrusted herself to it.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>When Rapha went out the underground research facility, Ohan was standing ahead.</p>

<p>“Ohan.”</p>

<p>Upon calling, Ohan pays look at her over the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ojou-sama. Done?”<br />
“Yes. It was successful. Yuuyami has rebooted, there’s no problem.”<br />
“Is that so.”</p>

<p>Rapha walked to Ohan and stopped beside him.</p>

<p>“Therefore, onee-sama will go.”<br />
“Where?”<br />
“Who knows,” Rapha shrugs her shoulders. “To somewhere, other than here. She was frequently saying of departing on exploration throughout the world​ together with Yuuyami.”<br />
“Is that so.”<br />
“And once again I will be left alone, right?”<br />
“It is different.”<br />
“Different?”</p>

<p>Rapha rose her gaze up at Ohan, afore her eyes met Ohan’s vermilion visual sensor.</p>

<p>“I am always, will  be with ojou-sama.”<br />
“Wah, Ohan isn’t a person.”<br />
“I am aware. Just stating the fact.”<br />
“Ohan’s tends to be impertinent. Is it, perhaps, influence of onee-chama? Or else since you touched Yuuyami’s emotions?”<br />
“Both. If this is not to ojou-sama liking, I will remove the log, turning back to my state of a month ago?”</p>

<p>Rapha thought it over for a moment,</p>

<p>“Can you place me on your shoulder?” she asked.<br />
“Understood.”</p>

<p>Ohan picked Rapha up and placed her upon the right shoulder.</p>

<p>“What a great view–.”</p>

<p>Desolate world. Neglected up to horizon. Rapha didn’t hate such a landscape.</p>

<p>“Ohan.”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
“It’s unnecessary to erase your log. After all, you diligently listen to my commands, aren’t you? So, there’s no problem.”<br />
“Understood.”</p>

<p>Following a breath of spring breeze, Rapha’s peach hair swayed.<br />
Whereafter Rapha tightly clung to Ohan’s head.</p>

<p>“Onee-chama herself, will be going away… But, I am, unable to prevent it.”</p>

<p>Over this month, Rapha came to understanding a present Lydia.<br />
If Lydia said she would go exploring the world, she definitely will.<br />
Even in case if I get in the way, undoubtedly would be brushed aside.<br />
Supposing I ask her to stay, she will smile, while saying: “I want to see the world with Yuuyami.”</p>

<p>“Why are not you going with her, ojou-sama?”<br />
“Ohan is fool​ as before, huh… I, have no interest in world exploration.”<br />
“Is that so.”<br />
“So it is. That’s why, I won’t go with her… I wish to study here so much as onee-chama desiring to explore the world…”<br />
“Someday, paths would come across.”<br />
“I think so. Hope so.”</p>

<p>Actually, Lydia should have been wake up together with Rapha, learn with her, and create the world together with her.<br />
But, Lydia woke up alone, studied with Yuuyami, will explore, and create the world together with Yuuyami.<br />
It’s lonely, and sad.<br />
However, it cannot be helped.<br />
Lydia isn’t a doll. She has regular life and volition.<br />
Just like Rapha.</p>

<p>“Before onee-chama will go, I have to talk to her, huh–.”</p>

<p>Regarding Angel Project, about themselves.<br />
And finally,<br />
concerning the person, who destroyed this world.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Dressed in her familiar maid outfit, Yuuyami alone egresses outside.<br />
Thereafter, she noticed Rapha, sitting upon Ohan’s shoulder.<br />
Yuuyami turns breathless, for situation was so picturesque.</p>

<p>“Ca, can you put me down, quickly!?”</p>

<p>At noticing Yuuyami, Rapha flusteredly made such request.<br />
Yuuyami couldn’t understand the reason of her being in such rush. Even though they looked very beautiful.<br />
Ohan brings Rapha back on the ground.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>Primly said Rapha, as though her impatience from moment ago was a lie.</p>

<p>“I wanted to have a little, chat with Ohan.”<br />
“Even though I’ve left you two alone, is it already enough?”<br />
“Yes. Thank you very much.”<br />
“And onee-chama?”<br />
“Drinking <em>café au lait</em>.”<br />
“Wah, I want to drink some too!”</p>

<p><em>Jog, jog</em>, Rapha ran down the stairs, afore disappearing within the underground research facility.</p>

<p>“Ohan.”</p>

<p>Yuuyami walked forth to Ohan.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Ohan didn’t move.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much.”<br />
“What is it for?”<br />
“For facilitation my processing, and for transmission my feelings, to Lydia.”<br />
“Is that so.”<br />
“At first, I was afraid of you.”<br />
“Is that so.”</p>

<p>Ohan’s voice was flat as ever.</p>

<p>“However now, I’m no longer afraid. You’re very kind AD.”<br />
“Is that so.”<br />
“Lydia was right. If one wouldn’t speak, wouldn’t get involved, they could never be able to understand anything. Not you nor Rapha-san.”</p>

<p>Due to Yuuyami’s fear of being destroyed by Ohan, she willed to avoid approaching Rapha and Ohan.<br />
Withal that, Lydia, carefree, with enthusiasm, twisted the throttle and advanced forth the two.<br />
It appears as though only yesterday.</p>

<p>“Ohan treats Rapha-san, with great care, aren’t you?”<br />
“I do not understand.”<br />
“Didn’t you placed her on your shoulder?”<br />
“Because I was ordered to.”<br />
“Mm…”</p>

<p>Slightly shrugged shoulders Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Is this the end of conversation?”</p>

<p>Likewise, Ohan was unconcerned.</p>

<p>“One more thing. Before long, we shall return to the library.”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
“But, we would be coming again.”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
“Upon that occasion, would it be alright to play​ together?”<br />
“Play?”<br />
“Indeed. Will that be okay?”<br />
“I do not understand it properly, but I do my best.”<br />
“Yes. Please, do. If anything, not myself but Lydia appeared eager to play with Ohan.”</p>

<p>Broadly smiled Yuuyami.</p>

<p>“Lydia-sama?”<br />
“Yes. A moment ago, I heard various things regarding Rapha-san and Ohan. Lydia consider Ohan is cool.”<br />
“Cool?”<br />
“Indeed. You are sparkling, large, and strong looking. She appears wishing to play with such you.”<br />
“Play…”</p>

<p>Of course, a military AD, Ohan, has no concept of plays. Yuuyami aware of that. Nevertheless, if they would teach him, he should be able to play.<br />
Albeit Ohan’s quantum brain of an old type, by no means a simple one.</p>

<p>“If it would snowing, we could have snowball fight, however it won’t snow for a while. Therefore, I guess, board game shall be good.”<br />
“Board game…”<br />
“Yes. I’m sure Ohan will be good at it. Well then.”</p>

<p>Smiled Yuuyami, afore turning on her heels.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Solitary, Ohan was rising upon the land.<br />
While executing his guarding duty,<br />
over and over again words of Yuuyami were reproduced in the quantum brain.<br />
And each time, the last scene was being paused.<br />
The scene, where Yuuyami smiled, saying, “Well then.”<br />
Ohan clipped out that moment, and saved it as snapshot.<br />
Then, attached a label to the data: <em>“important.”</em><br />
Ohan didn’t understand why he did so.<br />
Certain is… but one thing.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami is… beautiful.”</p>

<p>Blown by the wind, these murmured words vanished peacefully.</p>
