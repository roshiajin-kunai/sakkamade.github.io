    <p>Lydia and Rapha commenced working on the Dream Project.</p>

<p>“First of all, we need an ultra-high-performance Dream Server that will be able to re-emerge your dream, onee-chama.”<br />
“Uh-huh. I’m thinking to use altered connection of server resources.”</p>

<p>The two were talking within the laboratory whereas meddling with computers.</p>

<p>“Connection… Supercomputer’s connection?”<br />
“Yes, that one.”<br />
“This room would become half packed.”</p>

<p>Rapha slightly shrugged her shoulders.<br />
Afore world perishing, quantum computer considered to hold a highest throughput. That is the connection she mentioned.<br />
In prior of the collapse, brimming with dreams and expectations of engineers, the strongest computer was born.<br />
Therefore, supercomputer—the super quantum computer.<br />
However,<br />
such connection were hardly able to play any active role.<br />
Since world has been destroyed.<br />
An everlasting dream of engineers collapsed along with the world.<br />
Leaving behind but a data of legendary throughput as well as blueprints.</p>

<p>“You don’t mind?”<br />
“Naturally, but, please, onee-chama, commit changes of resources by yourself. I’m myself not really creative.”<br />
“Despite you told me to enjoy <em>la création du monde</em> with you?”<br />
“Yes, that’s right. I simply wanted to do that with onee-chama since you said you wished to. I’m primarily​ a researcher. It’s too tiresome to go outside.”<br />
“Is that so.”<br />
“Yes it is.”</p>

<p>Rapha proudly puffed out her chest for some reason.<br />
She must being proud to be researcher, guessed Lydia.</p>

<p>“Then, I will alter resources, could you assemble it with simple Parts Maker?”<br />
“If it’s just assembling, alright.”<br />
“During that time, I’ll develop device for measuring my brain waves while I’m dreaming.”</p>

<p>Thereon, measured data shall be interconnected against Dream Server via Lightning Blade.<br />
For re-emerging dream, which will be based on Lydia’s brain waves, to the Dream Server.<br />
With following sending main subroutine of Yuuyami, who shall be connected to the Dream Server via Lightning Blade.<br />
Being interconnected, data from Dream Server would be saving in Yuuyami’s storage.<br />
Lydia, of course, cannot slip out of her head.<br />
Hence, at the end, events within Dream Server will feedback to Lydia’s brain.<br />
<em>That</em> connection and Lightning Blade shouldn’t born much of time lag.<br />
Accordingly, it is expected for Lydia and Yuuyami to be able to talk together, on the spot.<br />
From Lydia perspective, information would flow of her brain to the Dream Server and afterwards back to Lydia’ brain.<br />
From Yuuyami’ side, data will stream against Yuuyami’s quantum brain, whereafter to Dream Server, and backward to her storage.<br />
Lydia and Yuuyami cannot be directly connected. With that as a reason, Dream Server is interposed to link them together.<br />
Upon such method, Lydia virtually invites Yuuyami into her dream.<br />
All of it having a sole purpose.<br />
To help Yuuyami. As much as that.<br />
Of course, it depends on Lydia, whether or not she could handle feelings of Yuuyami within her dream.</p>

<p>“When do you estimate to complete it?”<br />
“In one month.”<br />
“Now now, it’s too strict. Even for onee-chama.”<br />
“In one month, I will complete it.”</p>

<p>By that time, world shall grew much warmer.<br />
Most suitable season for exploration.<br />
For the sake to once again, on motorcycle, run across the world together with Yuuyami.<br />
For the sake of filling the world map, encounter plenty not yet known, and  play around in this world.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>Twenty-eight days have passed.<br />
Lydia was lying upon the cot.<br />
The helmet for measuring a brain waves is on her head, numerous electrodes were attached to both hands and feet.</p>

<p>“Well, then, onee-chama, I’ll supervise the procedure.”</p>

<p>Said, standing next to Lydia, Rapha, whereas peered down the Lydia’ face.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”<br />
“Step one, put onee-chama sleep. Step two, send weak electric signal of Yuuyami to the Dream Server.”<br />
“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>Lydia herself, heard from Rapha of a meagre area in Yuuyami’ quantum brain that was operating.<br />
The improbable signal which existed in quantum brain of Yuuyami wasn’t temporal. She has been monitoring for a long time, however it have no intentions to disappear.<br />
Consequently, firstly I try to use only that signal, decided Lydia.</p>

<p>“From there, depending on situation, at onee-chama cue, I will reboot Yuuyami. And thereat, sent Yuuyami’s main routine to Dream Server. In exactly the same moment, I arrange a virtual container in order for Yuuyami to keep her shape.”<br />
“I made it look akin to actual Yuuyami, so that Yuuyami wouldn’t be confused.”<br />
“But, onee-chama, I’m worried her breasts are slightly bigger than they actually are? Is there some ulterior motive?”</p>

<p>Container designed by Lydia— the virtual chest of Yuuyami was.</p>

<p>“It’s a measurement mistake. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>It’s not, in fact.<br />
Perhaps Lydia would embrace Yuuyami, so she purposely made it a little larger. Such would be more comfortable, she thought.<br />
Of course, Lydia has no discontent about actual bosom of Yuuyami.<br />
Only since it’s so long-awaited, she got a playful mood.</p>

<p>“So that’s how it is,” Rapha shrugged her shoulders. “Now then, after reboot, I will be monitoring everything.”<br />
“Uh-huh. Please take care of me.”<br />
“So, if I judge condition as dangerous, I will forcibly terminate the process.”<br />
“Whose condition? My? Yuuyami?”<br />
“Any of you.”<br />
“Is that so. Uh-huh. Thank you. But, wait until the last moment.”<br />
“Understood. Onee-chama values Yuuyami more than anything else, huh. Wah, seriously, I’m jealous.”<br />
“Ahaha.”</p>

<p>Lydia forced yourself to laugh.<br />
I spent almost a month with Rapha.<br />
Even so, I can’t understand Rapha, just as before.<br />
She kept saying unpleasant things as usual, instantly got mad, and all I can think about it ‘Is that so’.<br />
From Lydia standpoint, Rapha is constantly complicated and mysterious​ life-form.<br />
And yet,<br />
only two things are certain.<br />
Rapha’s abilities equal, or even greater, than Lydia’s. I can affirm it confidently. It felt as though to have another me.<br />
And second one.<br />
Rapha cherished Lydia.<br />
Rapha was obstinate and cannot accept new things. Therefore, many quarrels took a place. She don’t remember how many times they argued during the month.<br />
However, even so,<br />
she knew Rapha was cherishing Lydia.<br />
These two qualities should be enough.<br />
Now, Lydia recognised Rapha as an important friend or, perhaps, as little sister.</p>

<p>“Also, onee-chama, a verbal message from Ohan.”<br />
“From Ohan?”</p>

<p>It’s something novel, thought Lydia.<br />
Incidentally, right now Ohan is on a guarding duty upon the surface. That is Ohan’s primary job.<br />
Ohan being thereat for the sake of protection Rapha from outside invader​s.<br />
It’s doubtful whether there an outside invaders​ in this destroyed world, wondered Lydia.<br />
Nevertheless, every day Ohan stood alone upon the surface, unless there was a special business.</p>

<p>“<em>Go forth and conquer</em>, it was.”<br />
“Conquer…”</p>

<p>Lydia wryly smiled. Despite I’m not going to fight.</p>

<p>“Wah, it can’t be helped. Ohan for military use, that’s the best he can. Ohan himself asked to pass you a message, in the first place.”<br />
“That’s right. I have to express my gratitude later.”<br />
“If you do that, we are going to squabble again, so don’t.”<br />
“Rapha always loses, though.”<br />
“…T, time to begin.”</p>

<p><em>Whoosh</em>, Rapha turned away.<br />
Lydia giggled, afore closing the eyes.<br />
There we go, meeting Yuuyami.<br />
Whereas holding bouquets of irises in both hands.</p>

<p>◇</p>

<p>For a long time  Yuuyami been waiting under the darkness.<br />
Due to no concept of time existed here, she unable to perceive a duration of her waiting.<br />
Appears as though a moment, seeming eternity likewise.<br />
However she didn’t experience tedium. It was not to say under this darkness  being fun, but the present Yuuyami have no ability to feel boredom.<br />
Somehow, it is just therein. A tiny, tiny consciousness.<br />
She had no dread any more. She knew, Lydia trying to help.<br />
Mere believe in Lydia, simple waiting.<br />
Whereupon, exactly that suddenly occurred.<br />
The feeling, as though Yuuyami consciousness being torn off the darkness.<br />
It is flowing somewhere.<br />
What happened, Yuuyami have no insight.<br />
However, she was convicted in one thing. Upon my departing of this obscure world, Lydia surely would be there.<br />
Hence, consciousness of Yuuyami mildly tittered.<br />
Upon the following moment,<br />
world regained its lightness.<br />
Blue sky, it is as though pierced by a white clouds which seemed to be  comfortably floating.<br />
Apart from that,<br />
the lea of iris flowers unfolded before me up to horizon.<br />
Yuuyami observed them from within the body.<br />
Body. My body. However, something is different from usual.<br />
Yet, I do not possess the ability to acknowledge the difference.<br />
Notwithstanding that, I was able to move. Albeit, it did not work as expected, my motions were sluggish.</p>

<p>“Yuuyami, long time.”</p>

<p>Lydia rapidly arose from the flower lea.<br />
Voice of Lydia what I constantly wished to hear. Figure of Lydia upon which I perpetually desired to gaze.<br />
Yuuyami yearned to tightly hug Lydia.<br />
But withal, movements of my body were sluggish. Whilst upon attempt to spread my arms, they weren’t spread easily.</p>

<p>“Ah… ah…”</p>

<p>Albeit my wish to call Lydia’s name, I cannot speak. Language capability significantly reduced.</p>

<p>“Welcome to my dream.”</p>

<p>Smiled Lydia, like the sun.</p>
