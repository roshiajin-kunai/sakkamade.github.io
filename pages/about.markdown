In this website I publish my translations of Japanese web-novels. Occasionally gaining author's consent (if I can contact them and certain of translating it until the end).

At expiration of slightly over a month at [*WordPress*](https://sakkamade.wordpress.com/), I decided to move to [*GitHub*](https://github.com/) flavoured by  [*Jekyll*](https://jekyllrb.com/), hopefully to remain here, I am loving it so much!

#### Language Knowledge
{: class="with-indent"}

During the autumn of 2019 I was learning Japanese, simply because grew curious after reading some _manga_. Upon completion  a first course (first textbook of ~350 pages out of four) in  three months I have abandoned second volume nearly at first—twenty-fourth, to be exact—page for lack of motivation.
Despite I forgot mostly everything (on the time of starting my translations), with that piece of knowledge I was able to begin. 
"To begin somewhat"—from your point of view, most likely; 
"Uwah, I'm doing great"—from mine.

No one call off my problems of English indeed. But I am doing  best I am capable of upon the time of publishing the chapter.
My English knowledge (as of the end of 2020) is being utterly for British and American movies' subtitles; for translated from Japanese *manga* and novels; and for songs' lyrics, which had been accompanied by a constant look up dictionaries for unfamiliar words. Should confess I have never learned English with intention to write, just to be able to read and understand verbal language.

Must admit it is not sufficient. I do not have much of motivation, however, to learn Japanese nor English, presently. 
Well, with  that said, I _am_ learning both. Whereas working over my translations and reading books, the knowledge of mine, thus,  growing constantly, bit by bit. I expect.

#### Design
{: class="with-indent"}

The design for this website made entirely by me.

- [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/) - Japanese translation tool (you—and perhaps I—would not have seen so frequent an updates if not for this amazing tool);
